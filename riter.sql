(123, 6, 'First Story', 'I am writing a history of the things men do. I have written three such histories and I am but a young man. Already I have written three hundred, four hundred thousand words.\r\n\r\nMy wife is somewhere in this house where for hours now I have been sitting and writing. She is a tall woman with black hair, turning a little grey. Listen, she is going softly up a flight of stairs. All day she goes softly about, doing the housework in our house.\r\n\r\nI came here to this town from another town in the state of Iowa. My father was a workman, a house painter. He did not rise in the world as I have done. I worked my way through college and became an historian. We own this house in which I sit. This is my room in which I work. Already I have written three histories of peoples. I have told how states were formed and battles fought. You may see my books standing straight up on the shelves of libraries. They stand up like sentries.\r\n\r\nI am tall like my wife and my shoulders are a little stooped. Although I write boldly I am a shy man. I like being at work alone in this room with the door closed. There are many books here. Nations march back and forth in the books. It is quiet here but in the books a great thundering goes on.\r\n\r\nMy wife has a serious, almost stern look. Sometimes the thoughts I have concerning her frighten me. In the afternoon she leaves our house and goes for a walk. Sometimes she goes to stores, sometimes to visit a neighbor. There is a yellow house opposite our house. My wife goes out at a side door and passes along the street between our house and the yellow house.\r\n\r\nThe side door of our house bangs. There is a moment of waiting. My wife\'s face floats across the yellow background of a picture.\r\n\r\nLittle things are growing big in my mind. The window before my desk makes a little framed place like a picture. Every day I sit staring. I wait with an odd sensation of something impending. My hand trembles. The face that floats through the picture does something I don\'t understand. The face floats, then it stops. It goes from the right hand side to the left hand side, then it stops.\r\n\r\nThe face comes into my mind and goes out--the face floats in my mind. The pen has fallen from my fingers. The house is silent. The eyes of the floating face are turned away from me.\r\n\r\nMy wife is a girl who came here to this town from another town in the state of Ohio. We keep a servant but my wife often sweeps the floors and she sometimes makes the bed in which we sleep together. We sit together in the evening but I do not know her. I cannot shake myself out of myself. I wear a brown coat and I cannot come out of my coat. I cannot come out of myself. My wife is very gentle and she speaks softly but she cannot come out of herself.\r\n\r\nMy wife has gone out of the house. She does not know that I know every little thought of her life. I know what she thought when she was a child and walked in the streets of an Ohio town. I have heard the voices of her mind. I have heard the little voices. I heard the voice of fear crying when she was first overtaken with passion and crawled into my arms. Again I heard the voices of fear when her lips said words of courage to me as we sat together on the first evening after we were married and moved into this house.\r\n\r\nIt would be strange if I could sit here, as I am doing now, while my own face floated across the picture made by the yellow house and the window. It would be strange and beautiful if I could meet my wife, come into her presence.\r\n\r\nThe woman whose face floated across my picture just now knows nothing of me. I know nothing of her. She has gone off, along a street. The voices of her mind are talking. I am here in this room, as alone as ever any man God made.\r\n\r\nIt would be strange and beautiful if I could float my face across my picture. If my floating face could come into her presence, if it could come into the presence of any man or any woman--that would be a strange and beautiful thing to have happen.\r\n\r\nI\'ll tell you what--sometimes the whole life of this world floats in a human face in my mind. The unconscious face of the world stops and stands still before me.\r\n\r\nWhy do I not say a word out of myself to the others? Why, in all our life together, have I never been able to break through the wall to my wife?\r\n\r\nAlready I have written three hundred, four hundred thousand words. Are there no words that lead into life? Some day I shall speak to myself. Some day I shall make a testament unto myself.', '2018-01-06 17:14:17', '2018-01-15 06:01:18', 0),
(124, 7, 'An Angle in Disguise', 'Idleness, vice, and intemperance had done their miserable work, and the dead mother lay cold and still amid her wretched children. She had fallen upon the threshold of her own door in a drunken fit, and died in the presence of her frightened little ones.\r\n\r\nDeath touches the spring of our common humanity. This woman had been despised, scoffed at, and angrily denounced by nearly every man, woman, and child in the village; but now, as the fact of her death was passed from lip to lip, in subdued tones, pity took the place of anger, and sorrow of denunciation. Neighbors went hastily to the old tumble-down hut, in which she had secured little more than a place of shelter from summer heats and winter cold: some with grave-clothes for a decent interment of the body; and some with food for the half-starving children, three in number. Of these, John, the oldest, a boy of twelve, was a stout lad, able to earn his living with any farmer. Kate, between ten and eleven, was bright, active girl, out of whom something clever might be made, if in good hands; but poor little Maggie, the youngest, was hopelessly diseased. Two years before a fall from a window had injured her spine, and she had not been able to leave her bed since, except when lifted in the arms of her mother.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done with the children?\" That was the chief question now. The dead mother would go underground, and be forever beyond all care or concern of the villagers. But the children must not be left to starve. After considering the matter, and talking it over with his wife, farmer Jones said that he would take John, and do well by him, now that his mother was out of the way; and Mrs. Ellis, who had been looking out for a bound girl, concluded that it would be charitable in her to make choice of Katy, even though she was too young to be of much use for several years.\r\n\r\n\"I could do much better, I know,\" said Mrs. Ellis; \"but as no one seems inclined to take her, I must act from a sense of duty expect to have trouble with the child; for she\'s an undisciplined thing--used to having her own way.\"\r\n\r\nBut no one said \"I\'ll take Maggie.\" Pitying glances were cast on her wan and wasted form and thoughts were troubled on her account. Mothers brought cast-off garments and, removing her soiled and ragged clothes, dressed her in clean attire. The sad eyes and patient face of the little one touched many hearts, and even knocked at them for entrance. But none opened to take her in. Who wanted a bed-ridden child?\r\n\r\n\"Take her to the poorhouse,\" said a rough man, of whom the question \"What\'s to be done with Maggie?\" was asked. \"Nobody\'s going to be bothered with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"The poorhouse is a sad place for a sick and helpless child,\" answered one.\r\n\r\n\"For your child or mine,\" said the other, lightly speaking; \"but for tis brat it will prove a blessed change, she will be kept clean, have healthy food, and be doctored, which is more than can be said of her past condition.\"\r\n\r\nThere was reason in that, but still it didn\'t satisfy. The day following the day of death was made the day of burial. A few neighbors were at the miserable hovel, but none followed dead cart as it bore the unhonored remains to its pauper grave. Farmer Jones, after the coffin was taken out, placed John in his wagon and drove away, satisfied that he had done his part. Mrs. Ellis spoke to Kate with a hurried air, \"Bid your sister good by,\" and drew the tearful children apart ere scarcely their lips had touched in a sobbing farewell. Hastily others went out, some glancing at Maggie, and some resolutely refraining from a look, until all had gone. She was alone! Just beyond the threshold Joe Thompson, the wheelwright, paused, and said to the blacksmith\'s wife, who was hastening off with the rest,--\r\n\r\n\"It\'s a cruel thing to leave her so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take her to the poorhouse: she\'ll have to go there,\" answered the blacksmith\'s wife, springing away, and leaving Joe behind.\r\n\r\nFor a little while the man stood with a puzzled air; then he turned back, and went into the hovel again. Maggie with painful effort, had raised herself to an upright position and was sitting on the bed, straining her eyes upon the door out of which all had just departed, A vague terror had come into her thin white face.\r\n\r\n\"O, Mr. Thompson!\" she cried out, catching her suspended breath, \"don\'t leave me here all alone!\"\r\n\r\nThough rough in exterior, Joe Thompson, the wheelwright, had a heart, and it was very tender in some places. He liked children, and was pleased to have them come to his shop, where sleds and wagons were made or mended for the village lads without a draft on their hoarded sixpences.\r\n\r\n\"No, dear,\" he answered, in a kind voice, going to the bed, and stooping down over the child, \"You sha\'n\'t be left here alone.\" Then he wrapped her with the gentleness almost of a woman, in the clean bedclothes which some neighbor had brought; and, lifting her in his strong arms, bore her out into the air and across the field that lay between the hovel and his home.\r\n\r\nNow, Joe Thompson\'s wife, who happened to be childless, was not a woman of saintly temper, nor much given to self-denial for others\' good, and Joe had well-grounded doubts touching the manner of greeting he should receive on his arrival. Mrs. Thompson saw him approaching from the window, and with ruffling feathers met him a few paces from the door, as he opened the garden gate, and came in. He bore a precious burden, and he felt it to be so. As his arms held the sick child to his breast, a sphere of tenderness went out from her, and penetrated his feelings. A bond had already corded itself around them both, and love was springing into life.\r\n\r\n\"What have you there?\" sharply questioned Mrs. Thompson.\r\n\r\nJoe, felt the child start and shrink against him. He did not reply, except by a look that was pleading and cautionary, that said, \"Wait a moment for explanations, and be gentle;\" and, passing in, carried Maggie to the small chamber on the first floor, and laid her on a bed. Then, stepping back, he shut the door, and stood face to face with his vinegar-tempered wife in the passage-way outside.\r\n\r\n\"You haven\'t brought home that sick brat!\" Anger and astonishment were in the tones of Mrs. Joe Thompson; her face was in a flame.\r\n\r\n\"I think women\'s hearts are sometimes very hard,\" said Joe. Usually Joe Thompson got out of his wife\'s way, or kept rigidly silent and non-combative when she fired up on any subject; it was with some surprise, therefore, that she now encountered a firmly-set countenance and a resolute pair of eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Women\'s hearts are not half so hard as men\'s!\"\r\n\r\nJoe saw, by a quick intuition, that his resolute bearing had impressed his wife and he answered quickly, and with real indignation, \"Be that as it may, every woman at the funeral turned her eyes steadily from the sick child\'s face, and when the cart went off with her dead mother, hurried away, and left her alone in that old hut, with the sun not an hour in the sky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were John and Kate?\" asked Mrs. Thompson.\r\n\r\n\"Farmer Jones tossed John into his wagon, and drove off. Katie went home with Mrs. Ellis; but nobody wanted the poor sick one. \'Send her to the poorhouse,\' was the cry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn\'t you let her go, then. What did you bring her here for?\"\r\n\r\n\"She can\'t walk to the poorhouse,\" said Joe; \"somebody\'s arms must carry her, and mine are strong enough for that task.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why didn\'t you keep on? Why did you stop here?\" demanded the wife.\r\n\r\n\"Because I\'m not apt to go on fools\' errands. The Guardians must first be seen, and a permit obtained.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no gainsaying this.\r\n\r\n\"When will you see the Guardians?\" was asked, with irrepressible impatience.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why put it off till to-morrow? Go at once for the permit, and get the whole thing off of your hands to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jane,\" said the wheelwright, with an impressiveness of tone that greatly subdued his wife, \"I read in the Bible sometimes, and find much said about little children. How the Savior rebuked the disciples who would not receive them; how he took them up in his arms, and blessed them; and how he said that \'whosoever gave them even a cup of cold water should not go unrewarded.\' Now, it is a small thing for us to keep this poor motherless little one for a single night; to be kind to her for a single night; to make her life comfortable for a single night.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice of the strong, rough man shook, and he turned his head away, so that the moisture in his eyes might not be seen. Mrs. Thompson did not answer, but a soft feeling crept into her heart.\r\n\r\n\"Look at her kindly, Jane; speak to her kindly,\" said Joe. \"Think of her dead mother, and the loneliness, the pain, the sorrow that must be on all her coming life.\" The softness of his heart gave unwonted eloquence to his lips.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thompson did not reply, but presently turned towards the little chamber where her husband had deposited Maggie; and, pushing open the door, went quietly in. Joe did not follow; he saw that, her state had changed, and felt that it would be best to leave her alone with the child. So he went to his shop, which stood near the house, and worked until dusky evening released him from labor. A light shining through the little chamber windows was the first object that attracted Joe\'s attention on turning towards the house: it was a good omen. The path led him by this windows and, when opposite, he could not help pausing to look in. It was now dark enough outside to screen him from observation. Maggie lay, a little raised on the pillow with the lamp shining full upon her face. Mrs. Thompson was sitting by the bed, talking to the child; but her back was towards the window, so that her countenance was not seen. From Maggie\'s face, therefore, Joe must read the character of their intercourse. He saw that her eyes were intently fixed upon his wife; that now and then a few words came, as if in answers from her lips; that her expression was sad and tender; but he saw nothing of bitterness or pain. A deep-drawn breath was followed by one of relief, as a weight lifted itself from his heart.\r\n\r\nOn entering, Joe did not go immediately to the little chamber. His heavy tread about the kitchen brought his wife somewhat hurriedly from the room where she had been with Maggie. Joe thought it best not to refer to the child, nor to manifest any concern in regard to her.\r\n\r\n\"How soon will supper be ready?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Right soon,\" answered Mrs. Thompson, beginning to bustle about. There was no asperity in her voice.\r\n\r\nAfter washing from his hands and face the dust and soil of work, Joe left the kitchen, and went to the little bedroom. A pair of large bright eyes looked up at him from the snowy bed; looked at him tenderly, gratefully, pleadingly. How his heart swelled in his bosom! With what a quicker motion came the heart-beats! Joe sat down, and now, for the first time, examining the thin frame carefully under the lamp light, saw that it was an attractive face, and full of a childish sweetness which suffering had not been able to obliterate.\r\n\r\n\"Your name is Maggie?\" he said, as he sat down and took her soft little hand in his.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" Her voice struck a chord that quivered in a low strain of music.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been sick long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" What a sweet patience was in her tone!\r\n\r\n\"Has the doctor been to see you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He used to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any pain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes, but not now.\"\r\n\r\n\"When had you pain?\"\r\n\r\n\"This morning my side ached, and my back hurt when you carried me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It hurts you to be lifted or moved about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your side doesn\'t ache now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it ache a great deal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; but it hasn\'t ached any since I\'ve been on this soft bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The soft bed feels good.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, sir--so good!\" What a satisfaction, mingled with gratitude, was in her voice!\r\n\r\n\"Supper is ready,\" said Mrs. Thompson, looking into the room a little while afterwards.\r\n\r\nJoe glanced from his wife\'s face to that of Maggie; she understood him, and answered,--\r\n\r\n\"She can wait until we are done; then I will bring her somethings to eat.\" There was an effort at indifference on the part of Mrs. Thompson, but her husband had seen her through the window, and understood that the coldness was assumed. Joe waited, after sitting down to the table, for his wife to introduce the subject uppermost in both of their thoughts; but she kept silent on that theme, for many minutes, and he maintained a like reserve. At last she said, abruptly,--\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with that child?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you understood me that she was to go to the poorhouse,\" replied Joe, as if surprised at her question.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thompson looked rather strangely at her husband for sonic moments, and then dropped her eyes. The subject was not again referred to during the meal. At its close, Mrs. Thompson toasted a slice of bread, and softened, it with milk and butter; adding to this a cup of tea, she took them into Maggie, and held the small waiter, on which she had placed them, while the hungry child ate with every sign of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Is it good?\" asked Mrs. Thompson, seeing with what a keen relish the food was taken.\r\n\r\nThe child paused with the cup in her hand, and answered with a look of gratitude that awoke to new life old human feelings which had been slumbering in her heart for half a score of years.\r\n\r\n\"We\'ll keep her a day or two longer; she is so weak and helpless,\" said Mrs. Joe Thompson, in answer to her husband\'s remark, at breakfast-time on the next morning, that he must step down and see the Guardians of the Poor about Maggie.\r\n\r\n\"She\'ll be so much in your way,\" said Joe.\r\n\r\n\"I sha\'n\'t mind that for a day or two. Poor thing!\"\r\n\r\nJoe did not see the Guardians of the Poor on that day, on the next, nor on the day following. In fact, he never saw them at all on Maggie\'s account, for in less than a week Mrs. Joe Thompson would as soon leave thought of taking up her own abode in the almshouse as sending Maggie there.\r\n\r\nWhat light and blessing did that sick and helpless child bring to the home of Joe Thompson, the poor wheelwright! It had been dark, and cold, and miserable there for a long time just because his wife had nothing to love and care for out of herself, and so became sore, irritable, ill-tempered, and self-afflicting in the desolation of her woman\'s nature. Now the sweetness of that sick child, looking ever to her in love, patience, and gratitude, was as honey to her soul, and she carried her in her heart as well as in her arms, a precious burden. As for Joe Thompson, there was not a man in all the neighborhood who drank daily of a more precious wine of life than he. An angel had come into his house, disguised as a sick, helpless, and miserable child, and filled all its dreary chambers with the sunshine of love.', '2018-01-11 17:15:16', '2018-01-15 06:01:18', 0),
(129, 6, 'The Nightingale and the Rose', '\"She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,\" cried the young Student; \"but in all my garden there is no red rose.\"\n\nFrom her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.\n\n\"No red rose in all my garden!\" he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears. \"Ah, fon what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.\"\n\n\"Here at last is a true lover,\" said the Nightingale. \"Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him. His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.\"\n\n\"The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,\" murmured the young Student, \"and my love will be of the company. If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn. If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine. But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.\"\n\n\"Here indeed is the true lover,\" said the Nightingale. \"What I sing of, he suffers - what is joy to me, to him is pain. Surely Love is a wonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace. It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.\"\n\n\"The musicians will sit in their gallery,\" said the young Student, \"and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin. She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her. But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her\"; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.\n\n\"Why is he weeping?\" asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.\n\n\"Why, indeed?\" said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.\n\n\"Why, indeed?\" whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.\n\n\"He is weeping for a red rose,\" said the Nightingale.\n\n\"For a red rose?\" they cried; \"how very ridiculous!\" and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.\n\nBut the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student\'s sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.\n\nSuddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.\n\nIn the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.\n\n\"Give me a red rose,\" she cried, \"and I will sing you my sweetest song.\"\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n\"My roses are white,\" it answered; \"as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain. But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\"\n\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.\n\n\"Give me a red rose,\" she cried, \"and I will sing you my sweetest song.\"\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n\"My roses are yellow,\" it answered; \"as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe. But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student\'s window, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\"\n\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student\'s window.\n\n\"Give me a red rose,\" she cried, \"and I will sing you my sweetest song.\"\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n\"My roses are red,\" it answered, \"as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern. But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.\"\n\n\"One red rose is all I want,\" cried the Nightingale, \"only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?\"\n\n\"There is a way,\" answered the Tree; \"but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.\"\n\n\"Tell it to me,\" said the Nightingale, \"I am not afraid.\"\n\n\"If you want a red rose,\" said the Tree, \"you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart\'s-blood. You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn. All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.\"\n\n\"Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,\" cried the Nightingale, \"and Life is very dear to all. It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl. Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill. Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?\"\n\nSo she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.\n\nThe young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.\n\n\"Be happy,\" cried the Nightingale, \"be happy; you shall have your red rose. I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart\'s-blood. All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty. Flame- coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body. His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense.\"\n\nThe Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.\n\nBut the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.\n\n\"Sing me one last song,\" he whispered; \"I shall feel very lonely when you are gone.\"\n\nSo the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.\n\nWhen she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.\n\n\"She has form,\" he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove - \"that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling? I am afraid not. In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity. She would not sacrifice herself for others. She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish. Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice. What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.\" And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.\n\nAnd when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn. All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened. All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.\n\nShe sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl. And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song. Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river - pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn. As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.\n\nBut the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn. \"Press closer, little Nightingale,\" cried the Tree, \"or the Day will come before the rose is finished.\"\n\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.\n\nAnd a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride. But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose\'s heart remained white, for only a Nightingale\'s heart\'s-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.\n\nAnd the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn. \"Press closer, little Nightingale,\" cried the Tree, \"or the Day will come before the rose is finished.\"\n\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her. Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.\n\nAnd the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky. Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.\n\nBut the Nightingale\'s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes. Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.\n\nThen she gave one last burst of music. The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky. The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air. Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams. It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.\n\n\"Look, look!\" cried the Tree, \"the rose is finished now\"; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.\n\nAnd at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.\n\n\"Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!\" he cried; \"here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life. It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name\"; and he leaned down and plucked it.\n\nThen he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor\'s house with the rose in his hand.\n\nThe daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.\n\n\"You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,\" cried the Student. \"Here is the reddest rose in all the world. You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.\"\n\nBut the girl frowned.\n\n\"I am afraid it will not go with my dress,\" she answered; \"and, besides, the Chamberlain\'s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.\"\n\n\"Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,\" said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.\n\n\"Ungrateful!\" said the girl. \"I tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you? Only a Student. Why, I don\'t believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain\'s nephew has\"; and she got up from her chair and went into the house.\n\n\"What a silly thing Love is,\" said the Student as he walked away. \"It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true. In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.\"\n\nSo he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.', '2018-01-16 14:58:27', '2018-01-16 09:28:27', 0),
(130, 6, 'The Little Match Girl', 'Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and evening-- the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by dreadfully fast.\n\nOne slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.\n\nShe crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of sorrow, the poor little thing!\n\nThe flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought. From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year\'s Eve; yes, of that she thought.\n\nIn a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.\n\nHer little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew one out. \"Rischt!\" how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.\n\nShe rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another match. Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant\'s house.\n\nThousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when--the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail of fire.\n\n\"Someone is just dead!\" said the little girl; for her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.\n\nShe drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an expression of love.\n\n\"Grandmother!\" cried the little one. \"Oh, take me with you! You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!\" And she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.\n\nBut in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. \"She wanted to warm herself,\" people said. No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a new year.', '2018-01-16 15:18:34', '2018-01-16 09:48:34', 0),
(131, 6, 'The Selfish Giant', 'Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant\'s garden.\n\nIt was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them. \"How happy we are here!\" they cried to each other.\n\nOne day the Giant came back. He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years. After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.\n\n\"My own garden is my own garden,\" said the Giant; \"any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.\" So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.\n\nTRESPASSERS\nWILL BE\nPROSECUTED\n\nHe was a very selfish Giant.\n\nThe poor children had now nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. \"How happy we were there,\" they said to each other.\n\nThen the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. \"Spring has forgotten this garden,\" they cried, \"so we will live here all the year round.\" The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down. \"This is a delightful spot,\" he said, \"we must ask the Hail on a visit.\" So the Hail came. Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.\n\n\"I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,\" said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; \"I hope there will be a change in the weather.\"\n\nBut the Spring never came, nor the Summer. The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant\'s garden she gave none. \"He is too selfish,\" she said. So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.\n\nOne morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King\'s musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. \"I believe the Spring has come at last,\" said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.\n\nWhat did he see?\n\nHe saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children\'s heads. The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter. It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it. \"Climb up! little boy,\" said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.\n\nAnd the Giant\'s heart melted as he looked out. \"How selfish I have been!\" he said; \"now I know why the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children\'s playground for ever and ever.\" He was really very sorry for what he had done.\n\nSo he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again. Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming. And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant\'s neck, and kissed him. And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring. \"It is your garden now, little children,\" said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. And when the people were going to market at twelve o\'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.\n\nAll day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.\n\n\"But where is your little companion?\" he said: \"the boy I put into the tree.\" The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.\n\n\"We don\'t know,\" answered the children; \"he has gone away.\"\n\n\"You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,\" said the Giant. But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.\n\nEvery afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant. But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again. The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him. \"How I would like to see him!\" he used to say.\n\nYears went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden. \"I have many beautiful flowers,\" he said; \"but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.\"\n\nOne winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.\n\nSuddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. It certainly was a marvellous sight. In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.\n\nDownstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child. And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, \"Who hath dared to wound thee?\" For on the palms of the child\'s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.\n\n\"Who hath dared to wound thee?\" cried the Giant; \"tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.\"\n\n\"Nay!\" answered the child; \"but these are the wounds of Love.\"\n\n\"Who art thou?\" said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.\n\nAnd the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, \"You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise.\"\n\nAnd when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.', '2018-01-16 15:19:06', '2018-01-16 09:49:06', 0);

(132, 6, 'God Sees the Truth, But Waits', 'In the town of Vladimir lived a young merchant named Ivan Dmitrich Aksionov. He had two shops and a house of his own.\n\nAksionov was a handsome, fair-haired, curly-headed fellow, full of fun, and very fond of singing. When quite a young man he had been given to drink, and was riotous when he had had too much; but after he married he gave up drinking, except now and then.\n\nOne summer Aksionov was going to the Nizhny Fair, and as he bade good-bye to his family, his wife said to him, \"Ivan Dmitrich, do not start to-day; I have had a bad dream about you.\"\n\nAksionov laughed, and said, \"You are afraid that when I get to the fair I shall go on a spree.\"\n\nHis wife replied: \"I do not know what I am afraid of; all I know is that I had a bad dream. I dreamt you returned from the town, and when you took off your cap I saw that your hair was quite grey.\"\n\nAksionov laughed. \"That\'s a lucky sign,\" said he. \"See if I don\'t sell out all my goods, and bring you some presents from the fair.\"\n\nSo he said good-bye to his family, and drove away.\n\nWhen he had travelled half-way, he met a merchant whom he knew, and they put up at the same inn for the night. They had some tea together, and then went to bed in adjoining rooms.\n\nIt was not Aksionov\'s habit to sleep late, and, wishing to travel while it was still cool, he aroused his driver before dawn, and told him to put in the horses.\n\nThen he made his way across to the landlord of the inn (who lived in a cottage at the back), paid his bill, and continued his journey.\n\nWhen he had gone about twenty-five miles, he stopped for the horses to be fed. Aksionov rested awhile in the passage of the inn, then he stepped out into the porch, and, ordering a samovar to be heated, got out his guitar and began to play.\n\nSuddenly a troika drove up with tinkling bells and an official alighted, followed by two soldiers. He came to Aksionov and began to question him, asking him who he was and whence he came. Aksionov answered him fully, and said, \"Won\'t you have some tea with me?\" But the official went on cross-questioning him and asking him. \"Where did you spend last night? Were you alone, or with a fellow-merchant? Did you see the other merchant this morning? Why did you leave the inn before dawn?\"\n\nAksionov wondered why he was asked all these questions, but he described all that had happened, and then added, \"Why do you cross-question me as if I were a thief or a robber? I am travelling on business of my own, and there is no need to question me.\"\n\nThen the official, calling the soldiers, said, \"I am the police-officer of this district, and I question you because the merchant with whom you spent last night has been found with his throat cut. We must search your things.\"\n\nThey entered the house. The soldiers and the police-officer unstrapped Aksionov\'s luggage and searched it. Suddenly the officer drew a knife out of a bag, crying, \"Whose knife is this?\"\n\nAksionov looked, and seeing a blood-stained knife taken from his bag, he was frightened.\n\n\"How is it there is blood on this knife?\"\n\nAksionov tried to answer, but could hardly utter a word, and only stammered: \"I--don\'t know--not mine.\" Then the police-officer said: \"This morning the merchant was found in bed with his throat cut. You are the only person who could have done it. The house was locked from inside, and no one else was there. Here is this blood-stained knife in your bag and your face and manner betray you! Tell me how you killed him, and how much money you stole?\"\n\nAksionov swore he had not done it; that he had not seen the merchant after they had had tea together; that he had no money except eight thousand rubles of his own, and that the knife was not his. But his voice was broken, his face pale, and he trembled with fear as though he went guilty.\n\nThe police-officer ordered the soldiers to bind Aksionov and to put him in the cart. As they tied his feet together and flung him into the cart, Aksionov crossed himself and wept. His money and goods were taken from him, and he was sent to the nearest town and imprisoned there. Enquiries as to his character were made in Vladimir. The merchants and other inhabitants of that town said that in former days he used to drink and waste his time, but that he was a good man. Then the trial came on: he was charged with murdering a merchant from Ryazan, and robbing him of twenty thousand rubles.\n\nHis wife was in despair, and did not know what to believe. Her children were all quite small; one was a baby at her breast. Taking them all with her, she went to the town where her husband was in jail. At first she was not allowed to see him; but after much begging, she obtained permission from the officials, and was taken to him. When she saw her husband in prison-dress and in chains, shut up with thieves and criminals, she fell down, and did not come to her senses for a long time. Then she drew her children to her, and sat down near him. She told him of things at home, and asked about what had happened to him. He told her all, and she asked, \"What can we do now?\"\n\n\"We must petition the Czar not to let an innocent man perish.\"\n\nHis wife told him that she had sent a petition to the Czar, but it had not been accepted.\n\nAksionov did not reply, but only looked downcast.\n\nThen his wife said, \"It was not for nothing I dreamt your hair had turned grey. You remember? You should not have started that day.\" And passing her fingers through his hair, she said: \"Vanya dearest, tell your wife the truth; was it not you who did it?\"\n\n\"So you, too, suspect me!\" said Aksionov, and, hiding his face in his hands, he began to weep. Then a soldier came to say that the wife and children must go away; and Aksionov said good-bye to his family for the last time.\n\nWhen they were gone, Aksionov recalled what had been said, and when he remembered that his wife also had suspected him, he said to himself, \"It seems that only God can know the truth; it is to Him alone we must appeal, and from Him alone expect mercy.\"\n\nAnd Aksionov wrote no more petitions; gave up all hope, and only prayed to God.\n\nAksionov was condemned to be flogged and sent to the mines. So he was flogged with a knot, and when the wounds made by the knot were healed, he was driven to Siberia with other convicts.\n\nFor twenty-six years Aksionov lived as a convict in Siberia. His hair turned white as snow, and his beard grew long, thin, and grey. All his mirth went; he stooped; he walked slowly, spoke little, and never laughed, but he often prayed.\n\nIn prison Aksionov learnt to make boots, and earned a little money, with which he bought The Lives of the Saints. He read this book when there was light enough in the prison; and on Sundays in the prison-church he read the lessons and sang in the choir; for his voice was still good.\n\nThe prison authorities liked Aksionov for his meekness, and his fellow-prisoners respected him: they called him \"Grandfather,\" and \"The Saint.\" When they wanted to petition the prison authorities about anything, they always made Aksionov their spokesman, and when there were quarrels among the prisoners they came to him to put things right, and to judge the matter.\n\nNo news reached Aksionov from his home, and he did not even know if his wife and children were still alive.\n\nOne day a fresh gang of convicts came to the prison. In the evening the old prisoners collected round the new ones and asked them what towns or villages they came from, and what they were sentenced for. Among the rest Aksionov sat down near the newcomers, and listened with downcast air to what was said.\n\nOne of the new convicts, a tall, strong man of sixty, with a closely-cropped grey beard, was telling the others what be had been arrested for.\n\n\"Well, friends,\" he said, \"I only took a horse that was tied to a sledge, and I was arrested and accused of stealing. I said I had only taken it to get home quicker, and had then let it go; besides, the driver was a personal friend of mine. So I said, \'It\'s all right.\' \'No,\' said they, \'you stole it.\' But how or where I stole it they could not say. I once really did something wrong, and ought by rights to have come here long ago, but that time I was not found out. Now I have been sent here for nothing at all... Eh, but it\'s lies I\'m telling you; I\'ve been to Siberia before, but I did not stay long.\"\n\n\"Where are you from?\" asked some one.\n\n\"From Vladimir. My family are of that town. My name is Makar, and they also call me Semyonich.\"\n\nAksionov raised his head and said: \"Tell me, Semyonich, do you know anything of the merchants Aksionov of Vladimir? Are they still alive?\"\n\n\"Know them? Of course I do. The Aksionovs are rich, though their father is in Siberia: a sinner like ourselves, it seems! As for you, Gran\'dad, how did you come here?\"\n\nAksionov did not like to speak of his misfortune. He only sighed, and said, \"For my sins I have been in prison these twenty-six years.\"\n\n\"What sins?\" asked Makar Semyonich.\n\nBut Aksionov only said, \"Well, well--I must have deserved it!\" He would have said no more, but his companions told the newcomers how Aksionov came to be in Siberia; how some one had killed a merchant, and had put the knife among Aksionov\'s things, and Aksionov had been unjustly condemned.\n\nWhen Makar Semyonich heard this, he looked at Aksionov, slapped his own knee, and exclaimed, \"Well, this is wonderful! Really wonderful! But how old you\'ve grown, Gran\'dad!\"\n\nThe others asked him why he was so surprised, and where he had seen Aksionov before; but Makar Semyonich did not reply. He only said: \"It\'s wonderful that we should meet here, lads!\"\n\nThese words made Aksionov wonder whether this man knew who had killed the merchant; so he said, \"Perhaps, Semyonich, you have heard of that affair, or maybe you\'ve seen me before?\"\n\n\"How could I help hearing? The world\'s full of rumours. But it\'s a long time ago, and I\'ve forgotten what I heard.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you heard who killed the merchant?\" asked Aksionov.\n\nMakar Semyonich laughed, and replied: \"It must have been him in whose bag the knife was found! If some one else hid the knife there, \'He\'s not a thief till he\'s caught,\' as the saying is. How could any one put a knife into your bag while it was under your head? It would surely have woke you up.\"\n\nWhen Aksionov heard these words, he felt sure this was the man who had killed the merchant. He rose and went away. All that night Aksionov lay awake. He felt terribly unhappy, and all sorts of images rose in his mind. There was the image of his wife as she was when he parted from her to go to the fair. He saw her as if she were present; her face and her eyes rose before him; he heard her speak and laugh. Then he saw his children, quite little, as they: were at that time: one with a little cloak on, another at his mother\'s breast. And then he remembered himself as he used to be-young and merry. He remembered how he sat playing the guitar in the porch of the inn where he was arrested, and how free from care he had been. He saw, in his mind, the place where he was flogged, the executioner, and the people standing around; the chains, the convicts, all the twenty-six years of his prison life, and his premature old age. The thought of it all made him so wretched that he was ready to kill himself.\n\n\"And it\'s all that villain\'s doing!\" thought Aksionov. And his anger was so great against Makar Semyonich that he longed for vengeance, even if he himself should perish for it. He kept repeating prayers all night, but could get no peace. During the day he did not go near Makar Semyonich, nor even look at him.\n\nA fortnight passed in this way. Aksionov could not sleep at night, and was so miserable that he did not know what to do.\n\nOne night as he was walking about the prison he noticed some earth that came rolling out from under one of the shelves on which the prisoners slept. He stopped to see what it was. Suddenly Makar Semyonich crept out from under the shelf, and looked up at Aksionov with frightened face. Aksionov tried to pass without looking at him, but Makar seized his hand and told him that he had dug a hole under the wall, getting rid of the earth by putting it into his high-boots, and emptying it out every day on the road when the prisoners were driven to their work.\n\n\"Just you keep quiet, old man, and you shall get out too. If you blab, they\'ll flog the life out of me, but I will kill you first.\"\n\nAksionov trembled with anger as he looked at his enemy. He drew his hand away, saying, \"I have no wish to escape, and you have no need to kill me; you killed me long ago! As to telling of you--I may do so or not, as God shall direct.\"\n\nNext day, when the convicts were led out to work, the convoy soldiers noticed that one or other of the prisoners emptied some earth out of his boots. The prison was searched and the tunnel found. The Governor came and questioned all the prisoners to find out who had dug the hole. They all denied any knowledge of it. Those who knew would not betray Makar Semyonich, knowing he would be flogged almost to death. At last the Governor turned to Aksionov whom he knew to be a just man, and said:\n\n\"You are a truthful old man; tell me, before God, who dug the hole?\"\n\nMakar Semyonich stood as if he were quite unconcerned, looking at the Governor and not so much as glancing at Aksionov. Aksionov\'s lips and hands trembled, and for a long time he could not utter a word. He thought, \"Why should I screen him who ruined my life? Let him pay for what I have suffered. But if I tell, they will probably flog the life out of him, and maybe I suspect him wrongly. And, after all, what good would it be to me?\"\n\n\"Well, old man,\" repeated the Governor, \"tell me the truth: who has been digging under the wall?\"\n\nAksionov glanced at Makar Semyonich, and said, \"I cannot say, your honour. It is not God\'s will that I should tell! Do what you like with me; I am your hands.\"\n\nHowever much the Governor! tried, Aksionov would say no more, and so the matter had to be left.\n\nThat night, when Aksionov was lying on his bed and just beginning to doze, some one came quietly and sat down on his bed. He peered through the darkness and recognised Makar.\n\n\"What more do you want of me?\" asked Aksionov. \"Why have you come here?\"\n\nMakar Semyonich was silent. So Aksionov sat up and said, \"What do you want? Go away, or I will call the guard!\"\n\nMakar Semyonich bent close over Aksionov, and whispered, \"Ivan Dmitrich, forgive me!\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Aksionov.\n\n\"It was I who killed the merchant and hid the knife among your things. I meant to kill you too, but I heard a noise outside, so I hid the knife in your bag and escaped out of the window.\"\n\nAksionov was silent, and did not know what to say. Makar Semyonich slid off the bed-shelf and knelt upon the ground. \"Ivan Dmitrich,\" said he, \"forgive me! For the love of God, forgive me! I will confess that it was I who killed the merchant, and you will be released and can go to your home.\"\n\n\"It is easy for you to talk,\" said Aksionov, \"but I have suffered for you these twenty-six years. Where could I go to now?... My wife is dead, and my children have forgotten me. I have nowhere to go...\"\n\nMakar Semyonich did not rise, but beat his head on the floor. \"Ivan Dmitrich, forgive me!\" he cried. \"When they flogged me with the knot it was not so hard to bear as it is to see you now ... yet you had pity on me, and did not tell. For Christ\'s sake forgive me, wretch that I am!\" And he began to sob.\n\nWhen Aksionov heard him sobbing he, too, began to weep. \"God will forgive you!\" said he. \"Maybe I am a hundred times worse than you.\" And at these words his heart grew light, and the longing for home left him. He no longer had any desire to leave the prison, but only hoped for his last hour to come.\n\nIn spite of what Aksionov had said, Makar Semyonich confessed, his guilt. But when the order for his release came, Aksionov was already dead.', '2018-01-16 15:19:41', '2018-01-16 09:49:41', 0),
(133, 6, 'The Lady, or the Tiger?', 'IN THE very olden time, there lived a semi-barbaric king, whose ideas, though somewhat polished and sharpened by the progressiveness of distant Latin neighbors, were still large, florid, and untrammelled, as became the half of him which was barbaric. He was a man of exuberant fancy, and, withal, of an authority so irresistible that, at his will, he turned his varied fancies into facts. He was greatly given to self-communing; and, when he and himself agreed upon any thing, the thing was done. When every member of his domestic and political systems moved smoothly in its appointed course, his nature was bland and genial; but whenever there was a little hitch, and some of his orbs got out of their orbits, he was blander and more genial still, for nothing pleased him so much as to make the crooked straight, and crush down uneven places.\n\nAmong the borrowed notions by which his barbarism had become semified was that of the public arena, in which, by exhibitions of manly and beastly valor, the minds of his subjects were refined and cultured.\n\nBut even here the exuberant and barbaric fancy asserted itself. The arena of the king was built, not to give the people an opportunity of hearing the rhapsodies of dying gladiators, nor to enable them to view the inevitable conclusion of a conflict between religious opinions and hungry jaws, but for purposes far better adapted to widen and develop the mental energies of the people. This vast amphitheatre, with its encircling galleries, its mysterious vaults, and its unseen passages, was an agent of poetic justice, in which crime was punished. Or virtue rewarded, by the decrees of an impartial and incorruptible chance.\n\nWhen a subject was accused of a crime of sufficient importance to interest the king, public notice was given that on an appointed day the fate of tile accused person would be decided in the king\'s arena,--a structure which well deserved its name; for, although its form and plan were borrowed -from afar, its purpose emanated solely from the brain of this man, who, every barleycorn a king, knew no tradition to which he owed more allegiance than pleased his fancy, and who ingrafted on every adopted form of human thought and action the rich growth of his barbaric idealism.\n\nWhen all the people had assembled in the galleries, and the king, surrounded by his court, sat high up on his throne of royal state on one side of the arena, he gave a signal, a door beneath him opened, and the accused subject stepped out into the amphitheatre. Directly opposite him, on the other side of the enclosed space, were two doors, exactly alike and side by side. It was the duty and the privilege of the person on trial, to walk directly to these doors and open one of them. He could open either door he pleased: he was subject to no guidance or influence but that of the aforementioned impartial and incorruptible chance. If he opened the one, there came out of it a hungry tiger, the fiercest and most cruel that could be procured, which immediately sprang upon him, and tore him to pieces, as a punishment for his guilt. The moment that the case of the criminal was thus decided, doleful iron bells were clanged, great wails went up from the hired mourners posted on the outer rim of the arena, and the vast audience, with bowed heads and downcast hearts, wended slowly their homeward way, mourning greatly that one so young and fair, or so old and respected, should have merited so dire a fate.\n\nBut, if the accused person opened the other door, there came forth from it a lady, the most suitable to his years and station that his majesty could select among his fair subjects; and to this lady he was immediately married, as a reward of his innocence. It mattered not that he might already possess a wife and family, or that his affections might be engaged upon an object of his own selection: the king allowed no such subordinate arrangements to interfere with his great scheme of retribution and reward. The exercises, as in the other instance, took place immediately, and in the arena. Another door opened beneath the king, and a priest, followed by a band of choristers\' and dancing maidens blowing joyous airs on golden horns and treading an measure, advanced to where the pair stood side by side; and the wedding was promptly and cheerily solemnized. Then the gay brass bells rang forth their merry peals, the people shouted glad hurrahs, and the innocent man, preceded by children strewing flowers on his path, led his bride to his home.\n\nThis was the king\'s semi-barbaric method of administering justice. Its perfect fairness is obvious. The criminal could not know out of which door would come the lady: he opened either he pleased, without having the slightest idea whether, in the next instant, he was to be devoured or married. On some occasions the tiger came out of one door, and on some out of the other. The decisions of this tribunal were not only fair, they were positively determinate: the accused person was instantly punished if he found himself guilty; and, if innocent, he was rewarded on the spot, whether he liked it or not. There was no escape from the judgments or the king\'s arena.\n\nThe institution was a very popular one. When the people gathered together on one of the great trial days, they never knew whether they were to witness a bloody slaughter or a hilarious wedding. This element of uncertainty lent an interest to the occasion which it could not otherwise have attained. Thus, the masses were entertained and pleased, and the thinking part of the community could bring no charge of unfairness against this plan; for did not the accused person have the whole matter in his own hands?\n\nThis semi-barbaric king had a daughter as blooming as his most florid fancies, and with a soul as fervent and imperious as his own. As is usual in such cases, she was the apple of his eye, and was loved by him above all humanity. Among his courtiers was a young man of that fineness of blood and lowness of station common to the conventional heroes of romance who love royal maidens. This royal maiden was well satisfied with her lover, for he was handsome and brave to a degree unsurpassed in all this kingdom; and she loved him with an ardor that had enough of barbarism in it to make it exceedingly warm and strong. This love affair moved on happily for many months, until one day the king happened to discover its existence. He did not hesitate nor waver in regard to his duty in the premises. The youth was immediately cast into prison, and a day was appointed for his trial in the king\'s arena. This, of course, was an especially important occasion; and his majesty, as well as all the people, was greatly interested in the workings and development of this trial.\n\nNever before had such a case occurred; never before had a subject dared to love the daughter of a king. In after-years such things became commonplace enough; but then they were, in no slight degree, novel and startling.\n\nThe tiger-cages of the kingdom were searched for the most savage and relentless beasts, from which the fiercest monster might be selected for the arena; and the ranks of maiden youth and beauty throughout the land were carefully surveyed by competent judges, in order that he, young man, might have a fitting bride in case fate did not determine for him a different destiny. Of course, everybody knew that the deed with which the accused was charged had been done. He had loved the princess, and neither he, she, nor any one else thought of denying the fact; but the king would not think of allowing any fact of this kind to interfere with the workings of the tribunal, in which he took such great delight and satisfaction. No matter how the affair turned out, the youth would be disposed of; and the king would take an aesthetic pleasure in watching the course of events, which would determine whether or not the young man had done wrong in allowing himself to love the princess.\n\nThe appointed day arrived. From far and near the people gathered, and thronged the great galleries of the arena; and crowds, unable to gain admittance, massed themselves against its outside walls. The king and his court were in their places, opposite the twin doors,--those fateful portals, so terrible in their similarity.\n\nAll was ready. The signal was given. A door beneath the royal party opened, and the lover of the princess walked into the arena. Tall, beautiful, fair, his appearance was greeted with a low hum of admiration and anxiety. Half the audience had not known so grand a youth had lived among them. No wonder the princess loved him! What a terrible thing for him to be there!\n\nAs the youth advanced into the arena, he turned, as the custom was, to bow to the king: but he did not think at all of that royal personage; his eyes were fixed upon the princess, who sat to the right of her father. Had it not been for the moiety of barbarism in her nature, it is probable that lady would not have been there; but her intense and fervid soul would not allow her to be absent on an occasion in which she was so terribly interested. From the moment that the decree had gone forth, that her lover should decide his fate in the king\'s arena, she had thought of nothing, night or day, but this great event and the various subjects connected with it. Possessed of more power, influence, and force of character than any one who had ever before been interested in such a case, she had done what no other person had done,--she had possessed herself of the secret of the doors. She knew in which of the two rooms, that lay behind those doors, stood the cage of the tiger, with its open front, and in which waited the lady. Through these thick doors, heavily curtained with skins on the inside, it was impossible that any noise or suggestion should come from within to the person who should approach to raise the latch of one of them; but gold, and the power of a woman\'s will, had brought the secret to the princess.\n\nAnd not only did she know in which room stood the lady ready to emerge, all blushing and radiant, should her door be opened, but she knew who the lady was. It was one of tile fairest and loveliest of the damsels of the court who had been selected as the reward of the accused youth, should he be proved innocent of the crime of aspiring to one so far above him; and the princess hated her. Often had she seen, or imagined that she had seen, this fair creature throwing glances of admiration upon the person of her lover, and sometimes she thought these glances were perceived and even returned. Now and then she had seen them talking together; it was but for a moment or two, but much can be said in a brief space; it may have been on most unimportant topics, but how could she know that? The girl was lovely, but she had dared to raise her eyes to the loved one of the princess; and, with all the intensity of the savage blood transmitted to her through long lines of wholly barbaric ancestors, she hated the woman who blushed and trembled behind that silent door.\n\nWhen her lover turned and looked at her, and his eye met hers as she sat there paler and whiter than any one in the vast ocean of anxious faces about her, he saw, by that power of quick perception which is given to those whose souls are one, that she knew behind which door crouched the tiger, and behind which stood the lady. He had expected her to know it. He understood her nature, and his soul was assured that she would never rest until she had made plain to herself this thing, hidden to all other lookers-on, even to the king. The only hope for the youth in which there was any element of certainty was based upon the success of the princess in discovering this mystery; and the moment he looked upon her, he saw she had succeeded, as in his soul he knew she would succeed.\n\nThen it was that his quick and anxious glance asked the question: \"Which?\" It was as plain to her as if he shouted it from where he stood. There was not an instant to be lost. The question was asked in a Rash; it must be answered in another.\n\nHer right arm lay on the cushioned parapet before her. She raised her hand, and made a slight, quick movement toward the right. No one but her lover saw her. Every eye but his was fixed on the man in the arena.\n\nHe turned, and. with a firm and rapid step he walked across the empty space. Every heart stopped beating, every breath was held, every eye was fixed immovably upon that man. Without the slightest hesitation, he went to the door on the right, and opened it.\n\nNow, the point of the story is this: Did the tiger come out of that door, or did the lady?\n\nThe more we reflect upon this question, the harder it is to answer. It involves a study of the human heart which leads us through devious mazes of passion, out of which it is difficult to find our way. Think of it, fair reader, not as if the decision of the question depended upon yourself, but upon that hot-blooded, semi-barbaric princess, her soul at a white heat beneath the combined fires of despair and jealousy. She had lost him, but who should have him?\n\nHow often, in her waking hours and in her dreams, had she started in wild horror, and covered her face with her hands, as she thought of her lover opening the door on the other side of which waited the cruel fangs of the tiger!\n\nBut how much oftener had she seen him at the other door! How in her grievous reveries had she gnashed her teeth, and torn her hair, when she saw his start of rapturous delight as he opened the door of the lady! How her soul had burned in agony when she had seen him rush to meet that woman, with her flushing cheek and sparkling eve of triumph; when she had seen him lead her forth, his whole frame kindled with the joy of recovered life; when she had heard the glad shouts from the multitude, and the wild ringing of the happy bells; when she had seen the priest, with his joyous followers, advance to the couple, and make them man and wife before her very eyes; and when she had seen them walk away together upon their path of flowers, followed by the tremendous shouts of the hilarious multitude, in which her one despairing shriek was lost and drowned!\n\nWould it not be better for him to die at once, and go to wait for her in the blessed regions of semi-barbaric futurity?\n\nAnd yet, that awful tiger, those shrieks, that blood!\n\nHer decision had been indicated in an instant, but it had been made after days and nights of anguished deliberation. She had known she would be asked, she had decided what she would answer, and, without the slightest hesitation, she had moved her hand to the right.\n\nThe question of her decision is one not to be lightly considered, and it is not for me to presume to set myself up as the one person able to answer it. And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the opened door,--the lady, or the tiger?', '2018-01-16 15:20:13', '2018-01-16 09:50:13', 0),
(134, 6, 'Regret', 'MAMZELLE AURLIE possessed a good strong figure, ruddy cheeks, hair that was changing from brown to gray, and a determined eye. She wore a man\'s hat about the farm, and an old blue army overcoat when it was cold, and sometimes top-boots.\n\nMamzelle Aurlie had never thought of marrying. She had never been in love. At the age of twenty she had received a proposal, which she had promptly declined, and at the age of fifty she had not yet lived to regret it.\n\nSo she was quite alone in the world, except for her dog Ponto, and the negroes who lived in her cabins and worked her crops, and the fowls, a few cows, a couple of mules, her gun (with which she shot chicken-hawks), and her religion.\n\nOne morning Mamzelle Aurlie stood upon her gallery, contemplating, with arms akimbo, a small band of very small children who, to all intents and purposes, might have fallen from the clouds, so unexpected and bewildering was their coming, and so unwelcome. They were the children of her nearest neighbor, Odile, who was not such a near neighbor, after all.\n\nThe young woman had appeared but five minutes before, accompanied by these four children. In her arms she carried little Lodie; she dragged Ti Nomme by an unwilling hand; while Marcline and Marclette followed with irresolute steps.\n\nHer face was red and disfigured from tears and excitement. She had been summoned to a neighboring parish by the dangerous illness of her mother; her husband was away in Texas -- it seemed to her a million miles away; and Valsin was waiting with the mule-cart to drive her to the station.\n\n\"It\'s no question, Mamzelle Aurlie; you jus\' got to keep those youngsters fo\' me tell I come back. Dieu sait, I wouldn\' botha you with \'em if it was any otha way to do! Make \'em mine you, Mamzelle Aurlie; don\' spare \'em. Me, there, I\'m half crazy between the chil\'ren, an\' Lon not home, an\' maybe not even to fine po\' maman alive encore!\" -- a harrowing possibility which drove Odile to take a final hasty and convulsive leave of her disconsolate family.\n\nShe left them crowded into the narrow strip of shade on the porch of the long, low house; the white sunlight was beating in on the white old boards; some chickens were scratching in the grass at the foot of the steps, and one had boldly mounted, and was stepping heavily, solemnly, and aimlessly across the gallery. There was a pleasant odor of pinks in the air, and the sound of negroes\' laughter was coming across the flowering cotton-field.\n\nMamzelle Aurlie stood contemplating the children. She looked with a critical eye upon Marcline, who had been left staggering beneath the weight of the chubby Lodie. She surveyed with the same calculating air Marclette mingling her silent tears with the audible grief and rebellion of Ti Nomme. During those few contemplative moments she was collecting herself, determining upon a line of action which should be identical with a line of duty. She began by feeding them.\n\nIf Mamzelle Aurlie\'s responsibilities might have begun and ended there, they could easily have been dismissed; for her larder was amply provided against an emergency of this nature. But little children are not little pigs: they require and demand attentions which were wholly unexpected by Mamzelle Aurlie, and which she was ill prepared to give.\n\nShe was, indeed, very inapt in her management of Odile\'s children during the first few days. How could she know that Marclette always wept when spoken to in a loud and commanding tone of voice? It was a peculiarity of Marclette\'s. She became acquainted with Ti Nomme\'s passion for flowers only when he had plucked all the choicest gardenias and pinks for the apparent purpose of critically studying their botanical construction.\n\n\"\'T ain\'t enough to tell \'im, Mamzelle Aurlie,\" Marcline instructed her; \"you got to tie \'im in a chair. It\'s w\'at maman all time do w\'en he\'s bad: she tie \'im in a chair.\" The chair in which Mamzelle Aurlie tied Ti Nomme was roomy and comfortable, and he seized the opportunity to take a nap in it, the afternoon being warm.\n\nAt night, when she ordered them one and all to bed as she would have shooed the chickens into the hen-house, they stayed uncomprehending before her. What about the little white nightgowns that had to be taken from the pillow-slip in which they were brought over, and shaken by some strong hand till they snapped like ox-whips? What about the tub of water which had to be brought and set in the middle of the floor, in which the little tired, dusty, sun-browned feet had every one to be washed sweet and clean? And it made Marcline and Marclette laugh merrily -- the idea that Mamzelle Aurlie should for a moment have believed that Ti Nomme could fall asleep without being told the story of Croque-mitaine or Loup-garou, or both; or that lodie could fall asleep at all without being rocked and sung to.\n\n\"I tell you, Aunt Ruby,\" Mamzelle Aurlie informed her cook in confidence; \"me, I\'d rather manage a dozen plantation\' than fo\' chil\'ren. It\'s terrassent! Bont! don\'t talk to me about chil\'ren!\"\n\n\"T ain\' ispected sich as you would know airy thing \'bout \'em, Mamzelle Aurlie. I see dat plainly yistiddy w\'en I spy dat li\'le chile playin\' wid yo\' baskit o\' keys. You don\' know dat makes chillun grow up hard-headed, to play wid keys? Des like it make \'em teeth hard to look in a lookin\'-glass. Them\'s the things you got to know in the raisin\' an\' manigement o\' chillun.\"\n\nMamzelle Aurlie certainly did not pretend or aspire to such subtle and far-reaching knowledge on the subject as Aunt Ruby possessed, who had \"raised five an\' buried six\" in her day. She was glad enough to learn a few little mother-tricks to serve the moment\'s need.\n\nTi Nomme\'s sticky fingers compelled her to unearth white aprons that she had not worn for years, and she had to accustom herself to his moist kisses -- the expressions of an affectionate and exuberant nature. She got down her sewing-basket, which she seldom used, from the top shelf of the armoire, and placed it within the ready and easy reach which torn slips and buttonless waists demanded. It took her some days to become accustomed to the laughing, the crying, the chattering that echoed through the house and around it all day long. And it was not the first or the second night that she could sleep comfortably with little Lodie\'s hot, plump body pressed close against her, and the little one\'s warm breath beating her cheek like the fanning of a bird\'s wing.\n\nBut at the end of two weeks Mamzelle Aurlie had grown quite used to these things, and she no longer complained.\n\nIt was also at the end of two weeks that Mamzelle Aurlie, one evening, looking away toward the crib where the cattle were being fed, saw Valsin\'s blue cart turning the bend of the road. Odile sat beside the mulatto, upright and alert. As they drew near, the young woman\'s beaming face indicated that her home-coming was a happy one.\n\nBut this coming, unannounced and unexpected, threw Mamzelle Aurlie into a flutter that was almost agitation. The children had to be gathered. Where was Ti Nomme? Yonder in the shed, putting an edge on his knife at the grindstone. And Marcline and Marclette? Cutting and fashioning doll-rags in the corner of the gallery. As for Lodie, she was safe enough in Mamzelle Aurlie\'s arms; and she had screamed with delight at sight of the familiar blue cart which was bringing her mother back to her.\n\nTHE excitement was all over, and they were gone. How still it was when they were gone! Mamzelle Aurlie stood upon the gallery, looking and listening. She could no longer see the cart; the red sunset and the blue-gray twilight had together flung a purple mist across the fields and road that hid it from her view. She could no longer hear the wheezing and creaking of its wheels. But she could still faintly hear the shrill, glad voices of the children.\n\nShe turned into the house. There was much work awaiting her, for the children had left a sad disorder behind them; but she did not at once set about the task of righting it. Mamzelle Aurlie seated herself beside the table. She gave one slow glance through the room, into which the evening shadows were creeping and deepening around her solitary figure. She let her head fall down upon her bended arm, and began to cry. Oh, but she cried! Not softly, as women often do. She cried like a man, with sobs that seemed to tear her very soul. She did not notice Ponto licking her hand.', '2018-01-16 15:20:39', '2018-01-16 09:50:39', 0);

(135, 6, 'The Hanging Stranger', 'At five o\'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car out and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His back and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and wheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done okay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he liked the idea of repairing the foundations himself.\n\nIt was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying commuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and packages, students, swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks and businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red light and then started it up again. The store had been open without him; he\'d arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the records of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove slowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the town park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again he passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain and bench and single lamppost.\n\nFrom the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square.\n\nAgain he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn\'t a dummy. And if it was a display it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he swallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.\n\nIt was a body. A human body.\n\n\"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\"\n\nDon Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe coat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can\'t just leave the guy standing there.\"\n\n\"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up against the skyâ€”the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is. How the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What\'s wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n\nDon Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn\'t be there.\"\n\n\"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n\nFergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n\nJack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What\'s up, boys?\"\n\n\"There\'s a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I\'m going to call the cops.\"\n\n\"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn\'t be there.\"\n\n\"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business before pleasure.\"\n\nLoyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A man\'s body! A dead man!\" \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n\n\"You mean it\'s been there all afternoon?\"\n\n\"Sure. What\'s the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run. See you later, Ed.\"\n\nPotter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the sidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundleâ€”and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any attention.\n\n\"I\'m going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and crossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him. He gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n\nThe man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray suit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never seen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned away, and in the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin was gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A pair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His eyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n\n\"For Heaven\'s sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea and made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with revulsionâ€”and fear.\n\nWhy? Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n\nAndâ€”why didn\'t anybody notice?\n\nHe bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the man grated. \"Oh, it\'s you, Ed.\"\n\nEd nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n\n\"What\'s the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed\'s aim \"You look sick.\"\n\n\"The body. There in the park.\"\n\n\"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n\nMargaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something wrong?\"\n\n\"Ed\'s not feeling well.\"\n\nLoyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don\'t you see it? For God\'s sakeâ€”\" \"What\'s he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n\n\"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n\nMore people collected. \"Is he sick? It\'s Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n\n\"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at him. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n\n\"Edâ€”\"\n\n\"Better get a doctor!\"\n\n\"He must be sick.\"\n\n\"Or drunk.\"\n\nLoyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell. Through a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men and women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them toward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man, showing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service counter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically. His voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmuring around him.\n\n\"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don\'t stand there! Do something! Something\'s wrong! Something\'s happened! Things are going on!\" The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving efficiently toward Loyce.\n\n\"Name?\" the cop with the notebook murmured.\n\n\"Loyce.\" He mopped his forehead wearily. \"Edward C. Loyce. Listen to me. Back thereâ€”\"\n\n\"Address?\" the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through traffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the seat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath.\n\n\"1368 Hurst Road.\"\n\n\"That\'s here in Pikeville?\"\n\n\"That\'s right.\" Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. \"Listen to me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppostâ€”\"\n\n\"Where were you today?\" the cop behind the wheel demanded.\n\n\"Where?\" Loyce echoed.\n\n\"You weren\'t in your shop, were you?\"\n\n\"No.\" He shook his head. \"No, I was home. Down in the basement.\"\n\n\"In the basement?\"\n\n\"Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame. Why? What has that to do withâ€”\"\n\n\"Was anybody else down there with you?\"\n\n\"No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school.\" Loyce looked from one heavy-set cop to the other. Hope flickered across his face, wild hope. \"You mean because I was down there I missedâ€”the explanation? I didn\'t get in on it? Like everybody else?\" After a pause the cop with the notebook said: \"That\'s right. You missed the explanation.\"\n\n\"Then it\'s official? The bodyâ€”it\'s supposed to be hanging there?\"\n\n\"It\'s supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see.\"\n\nEd Loyce grinned weakly. \"Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep end. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like the Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking over.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands shaking. \"I\'m glad to know it\'s on the level.\"\n\n\"It\'s on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of Justice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights had not yet come on.\n\n\"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute. I guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there\'s no need to take me in, is there?\"\n\nThe two cops said nothing.\n\n\"I should be back at my store. The boys haven\'t had dinner. I\'m all right, now. No more trouble. Is there any need ofâ€”\" \"This won\'t take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short process. Only a few minutes.\"\n\n\"I hope it\'s short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a stoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting excited like that andâ€”\"\n\nLoyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled to his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light changed. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people, burrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, snouts, people running.\n\nThey weren\'t cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in Pikeville. A man couldn\'t own a store, operate a business in a small town for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n\nThey weren\'t copsâ€”and there hadn\'t been any explanation. Potter, Fergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn\'t knowâ€”and they didn\'t care. That was the strange part.\n\nLoyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the startled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the back door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete steps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side, gasping and panting.\n\nThere was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n\nHe was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and ruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street light wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n\nAnd to his rightâ€”the police station.\n\nHe was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery store rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred windows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the darkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to keep moving, get farther away from them.\n\nThem?\n\nLoyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the City Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass and broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark windows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n\nAndâ€”something else.\n\nAbove the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than the surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost into the sky.\n\nHe listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him struggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound. A buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n\nLoyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over the City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid. In the vortex something moved. Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky, pausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense swarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n\nShapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that hung above him. He was seeingâ€”them.\n\nFor a long time Loyce watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool of scummy water.\n\nThey were landing. Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the City Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of some kind. They flew and fluttered and came to restâ€”and then crawled crab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building.\n\nHe was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he shuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the City Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of the building and halting for a moment before going on.\n\nWere there more of them?\n\nIt didn\'t seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm weren\'t men. They were alienâ€”from some other world, some other dimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the universe. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm of being.\n\nOn the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved toward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter the City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others.\n\nLoyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight, clutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly fluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and came to rest among them.\n\nPseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves as men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration. Mimicry.\n\nLoyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The alley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe darkness made no difference to them.\n\nHe left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and women flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus stops stood waiting groups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the evening gloom.\n\nLoyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the bus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A moment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street.\n\nLoyce relaxed a little. He studied the people around him. Dulled, tired faces. People going home from work. Quite ordinary faces. None of them paid any attention to him. All sat quietly, sunk down in their seats, jiggling with the motion of the bus. The man sitting next to him unfolded a newspaper. He began to read the sports section, his lips moving. An ordinary man. Blue suit. Tie. A businessman, or a salesman. On his way home to his wife and family.\n\nAcross the aisle a young woman, perhaps twenty. Dark eyes and hair, a package on her lap. Nylons and heels. Red coat and white Angora sweater. Gazing absently ahead of her.\n\nA high school boy in jeans and black jacket.\n\nA great triple-chinned woman with an immense shopping bag loaded with packages and parcels. Her thick face dim with weariness. Ordinary people. The kind that rode the bus every evening. Going home to their families. To dinner.\n\nGoing homeâ€”with their minds dead. Controlled, filmed over with the mask of an alien being that had appeared and taken possession of them, their town, their lives. Himself, too. Except that he happened to be deep in his cellar instead of in the store. Somehow, he had been overlooked. They had missed him. Their control wasn\'t perfect, foolproof.\n\nMaybe there were others.\n\nHope flickered in Loyce. They weren\'t omnipotent. They had made a mistake, not got control of him. Their net, their field of control, had passed over him. He had emerged from his cellar as he had gone down. Apparently their power-zone was limited. A few seats down the aisle a man was watching him. Loyce broke off his chain of thought. A slender man, with dark hair and a small mustache. Well-dressed, brown suit and shiny shoes. A book between his small hands. He was watching Loyce, studying him intently. He turned quickly away.\n\nLoyce tensed. One of them? Orâ€”another they had missed?\n\nThe man was watching him again. Small dark eyes, alive and clever. Shrewd. A man too shrewd for themâ€”or one of the things itself, an alien insect from beyond.\n\nThe bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into the box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite Loyce.\n\nThe elderly man caught the sharp-eyed man\'s gaze. For a split second something passed between them. A look rich with meaning.\n\nLoyce got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step down into the well. He yanked the emergency door release. The rubber door swung open.\n\n\"Hey!\" the driver shouted, jamming on the brakes. \"What the hellâ€”?\"\n\nLoyce squirmed through. The bus was slowing down. Houses on all sides. A residential district, lawns and tall apartment buildings. Behind him, the bright-eyed man had leaped up. The elderly man was also on his feet. They were coming after him. Loyce leaped. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against the curb. Pain lapped over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness. Desperately, he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid down again. The bus had stopped. People were getting off.\n\nLoyce groped around. His fingers closed over something. A rock, lying in the gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed before him. A man, the bright-eyed man with the book.\n\nLoyce kicked. The man gasped and fell. Loyce brought the rock down. The man screamed and tried to roll away. \"Stop! For God\'s sake listenâ€”\"\n\nHe struck again. A hideous crunching sound. The man\'s voice cut off and dissolved in a bubbling wail. Loyce scrambled up and back. The others were there, now. All around him. He ran, awkwardly, down the sidewalk, up a driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped and were bending over the inert body of the man with the book, the bright-eyed man who had come after him.\n\nHad he made a mistake?\n\nBut it was too late to worry about that. He had to get outâ€”away from them. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between their world and his.\n\n\"Ed!\" Janet Loyce backed away nervously. \"What is it? Whatâ€”\"\n\nEd Loyce slammed the door behind him and came into the living room. \"Pull down the shades. Quick.\" Janet moved toward the window. \"Butâ€”\"\n\n\"Do as I say. Who else is here besides you?\"\n\n\"Nobody. Just the twins. They\'re upstairs in their room. What\'s happened? You look so strange. Why are you home?\"\n\nEd locked the front door. He prowled around the house, into the kitchen. From the drawer under the sink he slid out the big butcher knife and ran his finger along it. Sharp. Plenty sharp. He returned to the living room.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he said. \"I don\'t have much time. They know I escaped and they\'ll be looking for me.\"\n\n\"Escaped?\" Janet\'s face twisted with bewilderment and fear. \"Who?\"\n\n\"The town has been taken over. They\'re in control. I\'ve got it pretty well figured out. They started at the top, at the City Hall and police department. What they did with the real humans theyâ€”\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"We\'ve been invaded. From some other universe, some other dimension. They\'re insects. Mimicry. And more. Power to control minds. Your mind.\"\n\n\"My mind?\"\n\n\"Their entrance is here, in Pikeville. They\'ve taken over all of you. The whole townâ€”except me. We\'re up against an incredibly powerful enemy, but they have their limitations. That\'s our hope. They\'re limited! They can make mistakes!\" Janet shook her head. \"I don\'t understand, Ed. You must be insane.\"\n\n\"Insane? No. Just lucky. If I hadn\'t been down in the basement I\'d be like all the rest of you.\" Loyce peered out the window. \"But I can\'t stand here talking. Get your coat.\"\n\n\"My coat?\"\n\n\"We\'re getting out of here. Out of Pikeville. We\'ve got to get help. Fight this thing. They can be beaten. They\'re not infallible. It\'s going to be closeâ€”but we may make it if we hurry. Come on!\" He grabbed her arm roughly. \"Get your coat and call the twins. We\'re all leaving. Don\'t stop to pack. There\'s no time for that.\"\n\nWhite-faced, his wife moved toward the closet and got down her coat. \"Where are we going?\"\n\nEd pulled open the desk drawer and spilled the contents out onto the floor. He grabbed up a road map and spread it open. \"They\'ll have the highway covered, of course. But there\'s a back road. To Oak Grove. I got onto it once. It\'s practically abandoned. Maybe they\'ll forget about it.\"\n\n\"The old Ranch Road? Good Lordâ€”it\'s completely closed. Nobody\'s supposed to drive over it.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Ed thrust the map grimly into his coat. \"That\'s our best chance. Now call down the twins and let\'s get going. Your car is full of gas, isn\'t it?\"\n\nJanet was dazed.\n\n\"The Chevy? I had it filled up yesterday afternoon.\" Janet moved toward the stairs. \"Ed, Iâ€”\"\n\n\"Call the twins!\" Ed unlocked the front door and peered out. Nothing stirred. No sign of life. All right so far.\n\n\"Come on downstairs,\" Janet called in a wavering voice. \"We\'reâ€”going out for a while.\"\n\n\"Now?\" Tommy\'s voice came.\n\n\"Hurry up,\" Ed barked. \"Get down here, both of you.\"\n\nTommy appeared at the top of the stairs. \"I was doing my homework. We\'re starting fractions. Miss Parker says if we don\'t get this doneâ€”\"\n\n\"You can forget about fractions.\" Ed grabbed his son as he came down the stairs and propelled him toward the door. \"Where\'s Jim?\"\n\n\"He\'s coming.\"\n\nJim started slowly down the stairs. \"What\'s up, Dad?\"\n\n\"We\'re going for a ride.\"\n\n\"A ride? Where?\"\n\nEd turned to Janet. \"We\'ll leave the lights on. And the TV set. Go turn it on.\" He pushed her toward the set. \"So they\'ll think we\'re stillâ€”\"\n\nHe heard the buzz. And dropped instantly, the long butcher knife out. Sickened, he saw it coming down the stairs at him, wings a blur of motion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy. It was small, a baby one. A brief glimpseâ€”the thing hurtling at him, cold, multi-lensed inhuman eyes. Wings, body still clothed in yellow T-shirt and jeans, the mimic outline still stamped on it. A strange half-turn of its body as it reached him. What was it doing?\n\nA stinger.\n\nLoyce stabbed wildly at it. It retreated, buzzing frantically. Loyce rolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still as statues, faces blank. Watching without expression. Loyce stabbed again. This time the knife connected. The thing shrieked and faltered. It bounced against the wall and fluttered down.\n\nSomething lapped through his mind. A wall of force, energy, an alien mind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his own, touched against him briefly, shockingly. An utter alien presence, settling over himâ€”and then it flickered out as the thing collapsed in a broken heap on the rug.\n\nIt was dead. He turned it over with his foot. It was an insect, a fly of some kind. Yellow T-shirt, jeans. His son Jimmy... He closed his mind tight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely he scooped up his knife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood stone-still, neither of them moving.\n\nThe car was out. He\'d never get through. They\'d be waiting for him. It was ten miles on foot. Ten long miles over rough ground, gulleys and open fields and hills of uncut forest. He\'d have to go alone.\n\nLoyce opened the door. For a brief second he looked back at his wife and son. Then he slammed the door behind him and raced down the porch steps.\n\nA moment later he was on his way, hurrying swiftly through the darkness toward the edge of town.\n\nThe early morning sunlight was blinding. Loyce halted, gasping for breath, swaying back and forth. Sweat ran down in his eyes. His clothing was torn, shredded by the brush and thorns through which he had crawled. Ten milesâ€”on his hands and knees. Crawling, creeping through the night. His shoes were mud-caked. He was scratched and limping, utterly exhausted. But ahead of him lay Oak Grove.\n\nHe took a deep breath and started down the hill. Twice he stumbled and fell, picking himself up and trudging on. His ears rang. Everything receded and wavered. But he was there. He had got out, away from Pikeville.\n\nA farmer in a field gaped at him. From a house a young woman watched in wonder. Loyce reached the road and turned onto it. Ahead of him was a gasoline station and a drive-in. A couple of trucks, some chickens pecking in the dirt, a dog tied with a string.\n\nThe white-clad attendant watched suspiciously as he dragged himself up to the station. \"Thank God.\" He caught hold of the wall. \"I didn\'t think I was going to make it. They followed me most of the way. I could hear them buzzing. Buzzing and flitting around behind me.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" the attendant demanded. \"You in a wreck? A holdup?\"\n\nLoyce shook his head wearily. \"They have the whole town. The City Hall and the police station. They hung a man from the lamppost. That was the first thing I saw. They\'ve got all the roads blocked. I saw them hovering over the cars coming in. About four this morning I got beyond them. I knew it right away. I could feel them leave. And then the sun came up.\"\n\nThe attendant licked his lip nervously. \"You\'re out of your head. I better get a doctor.\"\n\n\"Get me into Oak Grove,\" Loyce gasped. He sank down on the gravel. \"We\'ve got to get startedâ€”cleaning them out. Got to get started right away.\"\n\nThey kept a tape recorder going all the time he talked. When he had finished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet. He stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his cigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face.\n\n\"You don\'t believe me,\" Loyce said.\n\nThe Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently away. \"Suit yourself.\" The Commissioner moved over to the window and stood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. \"I believe you,\" he said abruptly.\n\nLoyce sagged. \"Thank God.\"\n\n\"So you got away.\" The Commissioner shook his head. \"You were down in your cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.\"\n\nLoyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. \"I have a theory,\" he murmured.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting at the topâ€”the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a widening circle. When they\'re firmly in control they go on to the next town. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it\'s been going on for a long time.\"\n\n\"A long time?\"\n\n\"Thousands of years. I don\'t think it\'s new.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"When I was a kid... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A religious pictureâ€”an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah. Moloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtarothâ€”\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"They were all represented by figures.\" Loyce looked up at the Commissioner. \"Beelzebub was represented asâ€”a giant fly.\"\n\nThe Commissioner grunted. \"An old struggle.\"\n\n\"They\'ve been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They make gainsâ€”but finally they\'re defeated.\"\n\n\"Why defeated?\"\n\n\"They can\'t get everyone. They didn\'t get me. And they never got the Hebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The realization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they understood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed one of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\"\n\nThe Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did. Freak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He turned from the window, \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured everything out.\"\n\n\"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the lamppost. I don\'t understand that. Why? Why did they deliberately hang him there?\"\n\n\"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \"Bait.\"\n\nLoyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they\'d know who was under controlâ€”and who had escaped.\"\n\nLoyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they expected failures! They anticipatedâ€”\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\" \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The Commissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There\'s a lot to do. We must get moving. There\'s no time to waste.\"\n\nLoyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. \"And the man. Who was the man? I never saw him before. He wasn\'t a local man. He was a stranger. All muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashedâ€”\"\n\nThere was a strange look on the Commissioner\'s face as he answered, \"Maybe,\" he said softly, \"you\'ll understand that, too. Come along with me, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a glimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a platform of some sort. A telephone poleâ€”and a rope! \"Right this way,\" the Commissioner said, smiling coldly.\n\nAs the sun set, the vice-president of the Oak Grove Merchants\' Bank came up out of the vault, threw the heavy time locks, put on his hat and coat, and hurried outside onto the sidewalk. Only a few people were there, hurrying home to dinner.\n\n\"Good night,\" the guard said, locking the door after him.\n\n\"Good night,\" Clarence Mason murmured. He started along the street toward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the vault, examining the lay-out of the safety deposit boxes to see if there was room for another tier. He was glad to be finished.\n\nAt the corner he halted. The street lights had not yet come on. The street was dim. Everything was vague. He looked aroundâ€”and froze.\n\nFrom the telephone pole in front of the police station, something large and shapeless hung. It moved a little with the wind. What the hell was it?\n\nMason approached it warily. He wanted to get home. He was tired and hungry. He thought of his wife, his kids, a hot meal on the dinner table. But there was something about the dark bundle, something ominous and ugly.\n\nThe light was bad; he couldn\'t tell what it was. Yet it drew him on, made him move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made him uneasy. He was frightened by it. Frightenedâ€”and fascinated.\n\nAnd the strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it.', '2018-01-16 15:21:15', '2018-01-16 09:51:15', 0),
(136, 6, 'A Defensive Diamond', 'Treddleford sat in an easeful arm-chair in front of a slumberous fire, with a volume of verse in his hand and the comfortable consciousness that outside the club windows the rain was dripping and pattering with persistent purpose. A chill, wet October afternoon was merging into a bleak, wet October evening, and the club smoking-room seemed warmer and cosier by contrast. It was an afternoon on which to be wafted away from one\'s climatic surroundings, and \"The Golden journey to Samarkand\" promised to bear Treddleford well and bravely into other lands and under other skies. He had already migrated from London the rain-swept to Bagdad the Beautiful, and stood by the Sun Gate \"in the olden time\" when an icy breath of imminent annoyance seemed to creep between the book and himself. Amblecope, the man with the restless, prominent eyes and the mouth ready mobilised for conversational openings, had planted himself in a neighbouring arm-chair. For a twelvemonth and some odd weeks Treddleford had skilfully avoided making the acquaintance of his voluble fellow-clubman; he had marvellously escaped from the infliction of his relentless record of tedious personal achievements, or alleged achievements, on golf links, turf, and gaming table, by flood and field and covert-side. Now his season of immunity was coming to an end. There was no escape; in another moment he would be numbered among those who knew Amblecope to speak to - or rather, to suffer being spoken to.\n\nThe intruder was armed with a copy of Country Life, not for purposes of reading, but as an aid to conversational ice-breaking.\n\n\"Rather a good portrait of Throstlewing,\" he remarked explosively, turning his large challenging eyes on Treddleford; \"somehow it reminds me very much of Yellowstep, who was supposed to be such a good thing for the Grand Prix in 1903. Curious race that was; I suppose I\'ve seen every race for the Grand Prix for the last - \"\n\n\"Be kind enough never to mention the Grand Prix in my hearing,\" said Treddleford desperately; \"it awakens acutely distressing memories. I can\'t explain why without going into a long and complicated story.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly, certainly,\" said Amblecope hastily; long and complicated stories that were not told by himself were abominable in his eyes. He turned the pages of Country Life and became spuriously interested in the picture of a Mongolian pheasant.\n\n\"Not a bad representation of the Mongolian variety,\" he exclaimed, holding it up for his neighbour\'s inspection. \"They do very well in some covers. Take some stopping too, once they\'re fairly on the wing. I suppose the biggest bag I ever made in two successive days - \"\n\n\"My aunt, who owns the greater part of Lincolnshire,\" broke in Treddleford, with dramatic abruptness, \"possesses perhaps the most remarkable record in the way of a pheasant bag that has ever been achieved. She is seventy-five and can\'t hit a thing, but she always goes out with the guns. When I say she can\'t hit a thing, I don\'t mean to say that she doesn\'t occasionally endanger the lives of her fellow-guns, because that wouldn\'t be true. In fact, the chief Government Whip won\'t allow Ministerial M.P.\'s to go out with her; \'We don\'t want to incur by-elections needlessly,\' he quite reasonably observed. Well, the other day she winged a pheasant, and brought it to earth with a feather or two knocked out of it; it was a runner, and my aunt saw herself in danger of being done out of about the only bird she\'d hit during the present reign. Of course she wasn\'t going to stand that; she followed it through bracken and brushwood, and when it took to the open country and started across a ploughed field she jumped on to the shooting pony and went after it. The chase was a long one, and when my aunt at last ran the bird to a standstill she was nearer home than she was to the shooting party; she had left that some five miles behind her.\"\n\n\"Rather a long run for a wounded pheasant,\" snapped Amblecope.\n\n\"The story rests on my aunt\'s authority,\" said Treddleford coldly, \"and she is local vice-president of the Young Women\'s Christian Association. She trotted three miles or so to her home, and it was not till the middle of the afternoon that it was discovered that the lunch for the entire shooting party was in a pannier attached to the pony\'s saddle. Anyway, she got her bird.\"\n\n\"Some birds, of course, take a lot of killing,\" said Amblecope; \"so do some fish. I remember once I was fishing in the Exe, lovely trout stream, lots of fish, though they don\'t run to any great size - \"\n\n\"One of them did,\" announced Treddleford, with emphasis. \"My uncle, the Bishop of Southmolton, came across a giant trout in a pool just off the main stream of the Exe near Ugworthy; he tried it with every kind of fly and worm every day for three weeks without an atom of success, and then Fate intervened on his behalf. There was a low stone bridge just over this pool, and on the last day of his fishing holiday a motor van ran violently into the parapet and turned completely over; no one was hurt, but part of the parapet was knocked away, and the entire load that the van was carrying was pitched over and fell a little way into the pool. In a couple of minutes the giant trout was flapping and twisting on bare mud at the bottom of a waterless pool, and my uncle was able to walk down to him and fold him to his breast. The van-load consisted of blotting-paper, and every drop of water in that pool had been sucked up into the mass of spilt cargo.\"\n\nThere was silence for nearly half a minute in the smoking-room, and Treddleford began to let his mind steal back towards the golden road that led to Samarkand. Amblecope, however, rallied, and remarked in a rather tired and dispirited voice:\n\n\"Talking of motor accidents, the narrowest squeak I ever had was the other day, motoring with old Tommy Yarby in North Wales. Awfully good sort, old Yarby, thorough good sportsman, and the best - \"\n\n\"It was in North Wales,\" said Treddleford, \"that my sister met with her sensational carriage accident last year. She was on her way to a garden-party at Lady Nineveh\'s, about the only garden-party that ever comes to pass in those parts in the course of the year, and therefore a thing that she would have been very sorry to miss. She was driving a young horse that she\'d only bought a week or two previously, warranted to be perfectly steady with motor traffic, bicycles, and other common objects of the roadside. The animal lived up to its reputation, and passed the most explosive of motor- bikes with an indifference that almost amounted to apathy. However, I suppose we all draw the line somewhere, and this particular cob drew it at travelling wild beast shows. Of course my sister didn\'t know that, but she knew it very distinctly when she turned a sharp corner and found herself in a mixed company of camels, piebald horses, and canary-coloured vans. The dogcart was overturned in a ditch and kicked to splinters, and the cob went home across country. Neither my sister nor the groom was hurt, but the problem of how to get to the Nineveh garden-party, some three miles distant, seemed rather difficult to solve; once there, of course, my sister would easily find some one to drive her home. \'I suppose you wouldn\'t care for the loan of a couple of my camels?\' the showman suggested, in humorous sympathy. \' I would,\' said my sister, who had ridden camel-back in Egypt, and she overruled the objections of the groom, who hadn\'t. She picked out two of the most presentable- looking of the beasts and had them dusted and made as tidy as was possible at short notice, and set out for the Nineveh mansion. You may imagine the sensation that her small but imposing caravan created when she arrived at the hall door. The entire garden-party flocked up to gape. My sister was rather glad to slip down from her camel, and the groom was thankful to scramble down from his. Then young Billy Doulton, of the Dragoon Guards, who has been a lot at Aden and thinks he knows camel- language backwards, thought he would show off by making the beasts kneel down in orthodox fashion. Unfortunately camel words-of-command are not the same all the world over; these were magnificent Turkestan camels, accustomed to stride up the stony terraces of mountain passes, and when Doulton shouted at them they went side by side up the front steps, into the entrance hall, and up the grand staircase. The German governess met them just at the turn of the corridor. The Ninevehs nursed her with devoted attention for weeks, and when I last heard from them she was well enough to go about her duties again, but the doctor says she will always suffer from Hagenbeck heart.\"\n\nAmblecope got up from his chair and moved to another part of the room. Treddleford reopened his book and betook himself once more across\n\nThe dragon-green, the luminous, the dark, the serpent-haunted sea.\n\nFor a blessed half-hour he disported himself in imagination by the \"gay Aleppo-Gate,\" and listened to the bird-voiced singing-man. Then the world of to-day called him back; a page summoned him to speak with a friend on the telephone.\n\nAs Treddleford was about to pass out of the room he encountered Amblecope, also passing out, on his way to the billiard-room, where, perchance, some luckless wight might be secured and held fast to listen to the number of his attendances at the Grand Prix, with subsequent remarks on Newmarket and the Cambridgeshire. Amblecope made as if to pass out first, but a new-born pride was surging in Treddleford\'s breast and he waved him back.\n\n\"I believe I take precedence,\" he said coldly; \"you are merely the club Bore; I am the club Liar.\"', '2018-01-16 15:22:11', '2018-01-16 09:52:11', 0);

(137, 6, 'The Skylight Room', 'First Mrs. Parker would show you the double parlours. You would not dare to interrupt her description of their advantages and of the merits of the gentleman who had occupied them for eight years. Then you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you were neither a doctor nor a dentist. Mrs. Parker\'s manner of receiving the admission was such that you could never afterward entertain the same feeling toward your parents, who had neglected to train you up in one of the professions that fitted Mrs. Parker\'s parlours.\n\nNext you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second- floor-back at $8. Convinced by her second-floor manner that it was worth the $12 that Mr. Toosenberry always paid for it until he left to take charge of his brother\'s orange plantation in Florida near Palm Beach, where Mrs. McIntyre always spent the winters that had the double front room with private bath, you managed to babble that you wanted something still cheaper.\n\nIf you survived Mrs. Parker\'s scorn, you were taken to look at Mr. Skidder\'s large hall room on the third floor. Mr. Skidder\'s room was not vacant. He wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long. But every room-hunter was made to visit his room to admire the lambrequins. After each visit, Mr. Skidder, from the fright caused by possible eviction, would pay something on his rent.\n\nThen--oh, then--if you still stood on one foot, with your hot hand clutching the three moist dollars in your pocket, and hoarsely proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty, nevermore would Mrs. Parker be cicerone of yours. She would honk loudly the word\" Clara,\" she would show you her back, and march downstairs. Then Clara, the coloured maid, would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served for the fourth flight, and show you the Skylight Room. It occupied 7x8 feet of floor space at the middle of the hall. On each side of it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom.\n\nIn it was an iron cot, a washstand and a chair. A shelf was the dresser. Its four bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the sides of a coffin. Your hand crept to your throat, you gasped, you looked up as from a well--and breathed once more. Through the glass of the little skylight you saw a square of blue infinity.\n\n\"Two dollars, suh,\" Clara would say in her half-contemptuous, half- Tuskegeenial tones.\n\nOne day Miss Leeson came hunting for a room. She carried a typewriter made to be lugged around by a much larger lady. She was a very little girl, with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying: \"Goodness me ! Why didn\'t you keep up with us?\"\n\nMrs. Parker showed her the double parlours. \"In this closet,\" she said, \"one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal \"\n\n\"But I am neither a doctor nor a dentist,\" said Miss Leeson, with a shiver.\n\nMrs. Parker gave her the incredulous, pitying, sneering, icy stare that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists, and led the way to the second floor back.\n\n\"Eight dollars?\" said Miss Leeson. \"Dear me! I\'m not Hetty if I do look green. I\'m just a poor little working girl. Show me something higher and lower.\"\n\nMr. Skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap on his door.\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Skidder,\" said Mrs. Parker, with her demon\'s smile at his pale looks. \"I didn\'t know you were in. I asked the lady to have a look at your lambrequins.\"\n\n\"They\'re too lovely for anything,\" said Miss Leeson, smiling in exactly the way the angels do.\n\nAfter they had gone Mr. Skidder got very busy erasing the tall, black-haired heroine from his latest (unproduced) play and inserting a small, roguish one with heavy, bright hair and vivacious features.\n\n\"Anna Held\'ll jump at it,\" said Mr. Skidder to himself, putting his feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke like an aerial cuttlefish.\n\nPresently the tocsin call of \"Clara!\" sounded to the world the state of Miss Leeson\'s purse. A dark goblin seized her, mounted a Stygian stairway, thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words \"Two dollars!\"\n\n\"I\'ll take it!\" sighed Miss Leeson, sinking down upon the squeaky iron bed.\n\nEvery day Miss Leeson went out to work. At night she brought home papers with handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter. Sometimes she had no work at night, and then she would sit on the steps of the high stoop with the other roomers. Miss Leeson was not intended for a sky-light room when the plans were drawn for her creation. She was gay-hearted and full of tender, whimsical fancies. Once she let Mr. Skidder read to her three acts of his great (unpublished) comedy, \"It\'s No Kid; or, The Heir of the Subway.\"\n\nThere was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever Miss Leeson had time to sit on the steps for an hour or two. But Miss Longnecker, the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said, \"Well, really!\" to everything you said, sat on the top step and sniffed. And Miss Dorn, who shot at the moving ducks at Coney every Sunday and worked in a department store, sat on the bottom step and sniffed. Miss Leeson sat on the middle step and the men would quickly group around her.\n\nEspecially Mr. Skidder, who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a private, romantic (unspoken) drama in real life. And especially Mr. Hoover, who was forty-five, fat, flush and foolish. And especially very young Mr. Evans, who set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes. The men voted her \"the funniest and jolliest ever,\" but the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were implacable.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nI pray you let the drama halt while Chorus stalks to the footlights and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of Mr. Hoover. Tune the pipes to the tragedy of tallow, the bane of bulk, the calamity of corpulence. Tried out, Falstaff might have rendered more romance to the ton than would have Romeo\'s rickety ribs to the ounce. A lover may sigh, but he must not puff. To the train of Momus are the fat men remanded. In vain beats the faithfullest heart above a 52-inch belt. Avaunt, Hoover! Hoover, forty-five, flush and foolish, might carry off Helen herself; Hoover, forty-five, flush, foolish and fat is meat for perdition. There was never a chance for you, Hoover.\n\nAs Mrs. Parker\'s roomers sat thus one summer\'s evening, Miss Leeson looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh:\n\n\"Why, there\'s Billy Jackson! I can see him from down here, too.\"\n\nAll looked up--some at the windows of skyscrapers, some casting about for an airship, Jackson-guided.\n\n\"It\'s that star,\" explained Miss Leeson, pointing with a tiny finger. \"Not the big one that twinkles--the steady blue one near it. I can see it every night through my skylight. I named it Billy Jackson.\"\n\n\"Well, really!\" said Miss Longnecker. \"I didn\'t know you were an astronomer, Miss Leeson.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the small star gazer, \"I know as much as any of them about the style of sleeves they\'re going to wear next fall in Mars.\"\n\n\"Well, really!\" said Miss Longnecker. \"The star you refer to is Gamma, of the constellation Cassiopeia. It is nearly of the second magnitude, and its meridian passage is--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the very young Mr. Evans, \"I think Billy Jackson is a much better name for it.\"\n\n\"Same here,\" said Mr. Hoover, loudly breathing defiance to Miss Longnecker. \"I think Miss Leeson has just as much right to name stars as any of those old astrologers had.\"\n\n\"Well, really!\" said Miss Longnecker.\n\n\"I wonder whether it\'s a shooting star,\" remarked Miss Dorn. \"I hit nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at Coney Sunday.\"\n\n\"He doesn\'t show up very well from down here,\" said Miss Leeson. \"You ought to see him from my room. You know you can see stars even in the daytime from the bottom of a well. At night my room is like the shaft of a coal mine, and it makes Billy Jackson look like the big diamond pin that Night fastens her kimono with.\"\n\nThere came a time after that when Miss Leeson brought no formidable papers home to copy. And when she went out in the morning, instead of working, she went from office to office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office boys. This went on.\n\nThere came an evening when she wearily climbed Mrs. Parker\'s stoop at the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant. But she had had no dinner.\n\nAs she stepped into the hall Mr. Hoover met her and seized his chance. He asked her to marry him, and his fatness hovered above her like an avalanche. She dodged, and caught the balustrade. He tried for her hand, and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face. Step by step she went up, dragging herself by the railing. She passed Mr. Skidder\'s door as he was red-inking a stage direction for Myrtle Delorme (Miss Leeson) in his (unaccepted) comedy, to \"pirouette across stage from L to the side of the Count.\" Up the carpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the skylight room.\n\nShe was too weak to light the lamp or to undress. She fell upon the iron cot, her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs. And in that Erebus of the skylight room, she slowly raised her heavy eyelids, and smiled.\n\nFor Billy Jackson was shining down on her, calm and bright and constant through the skylight. There was no world about her. She was sunk in a pit of blackness, with but that small square of pallid light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh, so ineffectually named. Miss Longnecker must be right; it was Gamma, of the constellation Cassiopeia, and not Billy Jackson. And yet she could not let it be Gamma.\n\nAs she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm. The third time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to Billy Jackson. Her arm fell back limply.\n\n\"Good-bye, Billy,\" she murmured faintly. \"You\'re millions of miles away and you won\'t even twinkle once. But you kept where I could see you most of the time up there when there wasn\'t anything else but darkness to look at, didn\'t you? . . . Millions of miles. . . . Good-bye, Billy Jackson.\"\n\nClara, the coloured maid, found the door locked at 10 the next day, and they forced it open. Vinegar, and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail, some one ran to \'phone for an ambulance.\n\nIn due time it backed up to the door with much gong-clanging, and the capable young medico, in his white linen coat, ready, active, confident, with his smooth face half debonair, half grim, danced up the steps.\n\n\"Ambulance call to 49,\" he said briefly. \"What\'s the trouble?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, doctor,\" sniffed Mrs. Parker, as though her trouble that there should be trouble in the house was the greater. \"I can\'t think what can be the matter with her. Nothing we could do would bring her to. It\'s a young woman, a Miss Elsie--yes, a Miss Elsie Leeson. Never before in my house--\"\n\n\"What room?\" cried the doctor in a terrible voice, to which Mrs. Parker was a stranger.\n\n\"The skylight room. It--\n\nEvidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight rooms. He was gone up the stairs, four at a time. Mrs. Parker followed slowly, as her dignity demanded.\n\nOn the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his arms. He stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue, not loudly. Gradually Mrs. Parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail. Ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body. Sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her.\n\n\"Let that be,\" she would answer. \"If I can get forgiveness for having heard it I will be satisfied.\"\n\nThe ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that follow the curiosity chase, and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed, for his face was that of one who bears his own dead.\n\nThey noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the ambulance the form that he carried, and all that he said was: \"Drive like h**l, Wilson,\" to the driver.\n\nThat is all. Is it a story? In the next morning\'s paper I saw a little news item, and the last sentence of it may help you (as it helped me) to weld the incidents together.\n\nIt recounted the reception into Bellevue Hospital of a young woman who had been removed from No. 49 East -- street, suffering from debility induced by starvation. It concluded with these words:\n\n\"Dr. William Jackson, the ambulance physician who attended the case, says the patient will recover.\"', '2018-01-16 15:23:31', '2018-01-16 09:53:31', 0),
(138, 6, 'The Cactus', 'The most notable thing about Time is that it is so purely relative. A large amount of reminiscence is, by common consent, conceded to the drowning man; and it is not past belief that one may review an entire courtship while removing one\'s gloves.\n\nThat is what Trysdale was doing, standing by a table in his bachelor apartments. On the table stood a singular-looking green plant in a red earthen jar. The plant was one of the species of cacti, and was provided with long, tentacular leaves that perpetually swayed with the slightest breeze with a peculiar beckoning motion.\n\nTrysdale\'s friend, the brother of the bride, stood at a sideboard complaining at being allowed to drink alone. Both men were in evening dress. White favors like stars upon their coats shone through the gloom of the apartment.\n\nAs he slowly unbuttoned his gloves, there passed through Trysdale\'s mind a swift, scarifying retrospect of the last few hours. It seemed that in his nostrils was still the scent of the flowers that had been banked in odorous masses about the church, and in his ears the lowpitched hum of a thousand well-bred voices, the rustle of crisp garments, and, most insistently recurring, the drawling words of the minister irrevocably binding her to another.\n\nFrom this last hopeless point of view he still strove, as if it had become a habit of his mind, to reach some conjecture as to why and how he had lost her. Shaken rudely by the uncompromising fact, he had suddenly found himself confronted by a thing he had never before faced --his own innermost, unmitigated, arid unbedecked self. He saw all the garbs of pretence and egoism that he had worn now turn to rags of folly. He shuddered at the thought that to others, before now, the garments of his soul must have appeared sorry and threadbare. Vanity and conceit? These were the joints in his armor. And how free from either she had always been--But why--\n\nAs she had slowly moved up the aisle toward the altar he had felt an unworthy, sullen exultation that had served to support him. He had told himself that her paleness was from thoughts of another than the man to whom she was about to give herself. But even that poor consolation had been wrenched from him. For, when he saw that swift, limpid, upward look that she gave the man when he took her hand, he knew himself to be forgotten. Once that same look had been raised to him, and he had gauged its meaning. Indeed, his conceit had crumbled; its last prop was gone. Why had it ended thus? There had been no quarrel between them, nothing--\n\nFor the thousandth time he remarshalled in his mind the events of those last few days before the tide had so suddenly turned.\n\nShe had always insisted upon placing him upon a pedestal, and he had accepted her homage with royal grandeur. It had been a very sweet incense that she had burned before him; so modest (he told himself); so childlike and worshipful, and (he would once have sworn) so sincere. She had invested him with an almost supernatural number of high attributes and excellencies and talents, and he had absorbed the oblation as a desert drinks the rain that can coax from it no promise of blossom or fruit.\n\nAs Trysdale grimly wrenched apart the seam of his last glove, the crowning instance of his fatuous and tardily mourned egoism came vividly back to him. The scene was the night when he had asked her to come up on his pedestal with him and share his greatness. He could not, now, for the pain of it, allow his mind to dwell upon the memory of her convincing beauty that night--the careless wave of her hair, the tenderness and virginal charm of her looks and words. But they had been enough, and they had brought him to speak. During their conversation she had said:\n\n\"And Captain Carruthers tells me that you speak the Spanish language like a native. Why have you hidden this accomplishment from me? Is there anything you do not know?\"\n\nNow, Carruthers was an idiot. No doubt he (Trysdale) had been guilty (he sometimes did such things) of airing at the club some old, canting Castilian proverb dug from the hotchpotch at the back of dictionaries. Carruthers, who was one of his incontinent admirers, was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition.\n\nBut, alas! the incense of her admiration had been so sweet and flattering. He allowed the imputation to pass without denial. Without protest, he allowed her to twine about his brow this spurious bay of Spanish scholarship. He let it grace his conquering head, and, among its soft convolutions, he did not feel the prick of the thorn that was to pierce him later.\n\nHow glad, how shy, how tremulous she was! How she fluttered like a snared bird when he laid his mightiness at her feet! He could have sworn, and he could swear now, that unmistakable consent was in her eyes, but, coyly, she would give him no direct answer. \"I will send you my answer to-morrow,\" she said; and he, the indulgent, confident victor, smilingly granted the delay. The next day he waited, impatient, in his rooms for the word. At noon her groom came to the door and left the strange cactus in the red earthen jar. There was no note, no message, merely a tag upon the plant bearing a barbarous foreign or botanical name. He waited until night, but her answer did not come. His large pride and hurt vanity kept him from seeking her. Two evenings later they met at a dinner. Their greetings were conventional, but she looked at him, breathless, wondering, eager. He was courteous, adamant, waiting her explanation. With womanly swiftness she took her cue from his manner, and turned to snow and ice. Thus, and wider from this on, they had drifted apart. Where was his fault? Who had been to blame? Humbled now, he sought the answer amid the ruins of his self-conceit. If--\n\nThe voice of the other man in the room, querulously intruding upon his thoughts, aroused him.\n\n\"I say, Trysdale, what the deuce is the matter with you? You look unhappy as if you yourself had been married instead of having acted merely as an accomplice. Look at me, another accessory, come two thousand miles on a garlicky, cockroachy banana steamer all the way from South America to connive at the sacrifice--please to observe how lightly my guilt rests upon my shoulders. Only little sister I had, too, and now she\'s gone. Come now! take something to ease your conscience.\"\n\n\"I don\'t drink just now, thanks,\" said Trysdale.\n\n\"Your brandy,\" resumed the other, coming over and joining him, \"is abominable.

(141, 6, 'The Fisherman and His Soul', 'Every evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and threw his nets into the water.\r\n\r\nWhen the wind blew from the land he caught nothing, or but little at best, for it was a bitter and black-winged wind, and rough waves rose up to meet it. But when the wind blew to the shore, the fish came in from the deep, and swam into the meshes of his nets, and he took them to the market-place and sold them.\r\n\r\nEvery evening he went out upon the sea, and one evening the net was so heavy that hardly could he draw it into the boat. And he laughed, and said to himself \'Surely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared some dull monster that will be a marvel to men, or some thing of horror that the great Queen will desire,\' and putting forth all his strength, he tugged at the coarse ropes till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase of bronze, the long veins rose up on his arms. He tugged at the thin ropes, and nearer and nearer came the circle of flat corks, and the net rose at last to the top of the water.\r\n\r\nBut no fish at all was in it, nor any monster or thing of horror, but only a little Mermaid lying fast asleep.\r\n\r\nHer hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as a thread of line gold in a cup of glass. Her body was as white ivory, and her tail was of silver and pearl. Silver and pearl was her tail, and the green weeds of the sea coiled round it; and like sea-shells were her ears, and her lips were like sea-coral. The cold waves dashed over her cold breasts, and the salt glistened upon her eyelids.\r\n\r\nSo beautiful was she that when the young Fisherman saw her he was filled with wonder, and he put out his hand and drew the net close to him, and leaning over the side he clasped her in his arms. And when he touched her, she gave a cry like a startled sea-gull and woke, and looked at him in terror with her mauve-amethyst eyes, and struggled that she might escape. But he held her tightly to him, and would not suffer her to depart.\r\n\r\nAnd when she saw that she could in no way escape from him, she began to weep, and said, \'I pray thee let me go, for I am the only daughter of a King, and my father is aged and alone.\'\r\n\r\nBut the young Fisherman answered, \'I will not let thee go save thou makest me a promise that whenever I call thee, thou wilt come and sing to me, for the fish delight to listen to the song of the Sea-folk, and so shall my nets be full.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wilt thou in very truth let me go, if I promise thee this?\' cried the Mermaid.\r\n\r\n\'In very truth I will let thee go,\' said the young Fisherman. So she made him the promise he desired, and sware it by the oath of the Sea-folk. And he loosened his arms from about her, and she sank down into the water, trembling with a strange fear.\r\n\r\nEvery evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and called to the Mermaid, and she rose out of the water and sang to him. Round and round her swam the dolphins, and the wild gulls wheeled above her head.\r\n\r\nAnd she sang a marvellous song. For she sang of the Sea-folk who drive their flocks from cave to cave, and carry the little calves on their shoulders; of the Tritons who have long green beards, and hairy breasts, and blow through twisted conchs when the King passes by; of the palace of the King which is all of amber, with a roof of clear emerald, and a pavement of bright pearl; and of the gardens of the sea where the great filigrane fans of coral wave all day long, and the fish dart about like silver birds, and the anemones cling to the rocks, and the pinks bourgeon in the ribbed yellow sand. She sang of the big whales that come down from the north seas and have sharp icicles hanging to their fins; of the Sirens who tell of such wonderful things that the merchants have to stop their ears with wax lest they should hear them, and leap into the water and be drowned; of the sunken galleys with their tall masts, and the frozen sailors clinging to the rigging, and the mackerel swimming in and out of the open portholes; of the little barnacles who are great travellers, and cling to the keels of the ships and go round and round the world; and of the cuttlefish who live in the sides of the cliffs and stretch out their long black arms, and can make night come when they will it. She sang of the nautilus who has a boat of her own that is carved out of an opal and steered with a silken sail; of the happy Mermen who play upon harps and can charm the great Kraken to sleep; of the little children who catch hold of the slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon their backs; of the Mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their arms to the mariners; and of the sea-lions with their curved tusks, and the sea-horses with their floating manes.\r\n\r\nAnd as she sang, all the funny-fish came in from the deep to listen to her, and the young Fisherman threw his nets round them and caught them, and others he took with a spear. And when his boat was well-laden, the Mermaid would sink down into the sea, smiling at him.\r\n\r\nYet would she never come near him that he might touch her. Often times he called to her and prayed of her, but she would not; and when he sought to seize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive, nor did he see her again that day. And each day the sound of her voice became sweeter to his ears. So sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his cunning, and had no care of his craft. Vermilion-finned and with eyes of bossy gold, the tunnies went by in shoals, but he heeded them not. His spear lay by his side unused, and his baskets of plaited osier were empty. With lips parted, and eyes dim with wonder, he sat idle in his boat and listened, listening till the sea-mists crept round him, and the wandering moon stained his brown limbs with silver.\r\n\r\nAnd one evening he called to her, and said: \'Little Mermaid, little Mermaid, I love thee. Take me for thy bridegroom, for I love thee.\'\r\n\r\nBut the Mermaid shook her head. \'Thou hast a human soul,\' she answered. \'If only thou would\'st send away thy soul, then could I love thee.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the young Fisherman said to himself \'Of what use is my soul to me? I cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it. Surely I will send it away from me, and much gladness shall be mine.\' And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and standing up in the painted boat, he held out his arms to the Mermaid. \'I will send my soul away,\' he cried, \'and you shall be my bride, and I will be the bridegroom, and in the depth of the sea we will dwell together, and all that thou hast sung of thou shalt show me, and all that thou desirest I will do, nor shall our lives be divided.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the little Mermaid laughed for pleasure, and hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n\'But how shall I send my soul from me?\' cried the young Fisherman. \'Tell me how I may do it, and lo! it shall be done.\'\r\n\r\n\'Alas! I know not,\' said the little Mermaid: \'the Sea-folk have no souls.\' And she sank down into the deep, looking wistfully at him.\r\n\r\nNow early on the next morning, before the sun was the span of a man\'s hand above the hill, the young Fisherman went to the house of the Priest and knocked three times at the door.\r\n\r\nThe novice looked out through the wicket, and where he saw who it was, he drew back the latch and said to him, \'Enter.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the young Fisherman passed in, and knelt down on the sweet-smelling rushes of the floor, and cried to the Priest who was reading out of the Holy Book and said to him, \'Father, I am in love with one of the Sea-folk, and my soul hindereth me from having my desire. Tell me how I can send my soul away from me, for in truth I have no need of it. Of what value is my soul to me? I cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the Priest beat his breast, and answered, \'Alack, Alack, thou art mad, or hast eaten of poisonous herb, for the soul is the noblest part of man, and was given to us by God that we should nobly use it. There is no thing more precious than a human soul, nor any earthly thing that can be weighed with it. It is worth all the gold that is in the world, and is more precious than the rubies of the kings. Therefore, my son, think not any more of this matter, for it is a sin that may not be forgiven. And as for the Sea-folk, they are lost, and they who would traffic with them are lost also. They are as the beasts of the field that know not good from evil, and for them the Lord has not died.\'\r\n\r\nThe young Fisherman\'s eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter words of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said to him, \'Father, the Fauns live in the forest and are glad, and on the rocks sit the Mermen with their harps of red gold. Let me be as they are, I beseech thee, for their days are as the days of flowers. And as for my soul, what doth my soul profit me, if it stand between me and the thing that I love?\'\r\n\r\n\'The love of the body is vile,\' cried the Priest, knitting his brows, \'and vile and evil are the pagan things God suffers to wander through His world. Accursed be the Fauns of the woodland, and accursed be the singers of the sea! I have heard them at night-time, and they have sought to lure me from my beads. They tap at the window, and laugh. They whisper into my ears the tale of their perilous joys. They tempt me with temptations, and when I would pray they make mouths at me. They are lost, I tell thee, they are lost. For them there is no heaven nor hell, and in neither shall they praise God\'s name.\'\r\n\r\n\'Father,\' cried the young Fisherman, \'thou knowest not what thou sayest. Once in my net I snared the daughter of a King. She is fairer than the morning star, and whiter than the moon. For her body I would give my soul, and for her love I would surrender heaven. Tell me what I ask of thee, and let me go in peace.\'\r\n\r\n\'Away! Away!\' cried the Priest: \'thy leman is lost, and thou shalt be lost with her.\' And he gave him no blessing, but drove him from his door.\r\n\r\nAnd the young Fisherman went down into the market-place, and he walked slowly, and with bowed head, as one who is in sorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd when the merchants saw him coming, they began to whisper to each other, and one of them came forth to meet him, and called him by name, and said to him, \'What hast thou to sell?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will sell thee my soul,\' he answered: \'I pray thee buy it off me, for I am weary of it. Of what use is my soul to me? I cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it.\'\r\n\r\nBut the merchants mocked at him, and said, \'Of what use is a man\'s soul to us? It is not worth a clipped piece of silver. Sell us thy body for a slave, and we will clothe thee in sea-purple, and put a ring upon thy finger, and make thee the minion of the great Queen. But talk not of the soul, for to us it is nought, nor has it any value for our service.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the young Fisherman said to himself: \'How strange a thing this is! The Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.\' And he passed out of the market-place, and went down to the shore of the sea, and began to ponder on what he should do.\r\n\r\nAnd at noon he remembered how one of his companions, who was a gatherer of samphire, had told him of a certain young Witch who dwelt in a cave at the head of the bay and was very cunning in her witcheries. And he set to and ran, so eager was he to get rid of his soul, and a cloud of dust followed him as he sped round the sand of the shore. By the itching of her palm the young Witch knew his coming, and she laughed and let down her red hair. With her red hair falling around her, she stood at the opening of the cave, and in her hand she had a spray of wild hemlock that was blossoming.\r\n\r\n\'What d\'ye lack? What d\'ye lack?\' she cried, as he came panting up the steep, and bent down before her. \'Fish for thy net, when the wind is foul? I have a little reed-pipe, and when I blow on it the mullet come sailing into the bay. But it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price. What d\'ye lack? What d\'ye lack? A storm to wreck the ships, and wash the chests of rich treasure ashore? I have more storms than the wind has, for I serve one who is stronger than the wind, and with a sieve and a pail of water I can send the great galleys to the bottom of the sea. But I have a price, pretty boy, I have a price. What d\'ye lack? What d\'ye lack? I know a flower that grows in the valley, none knows it but I. It has purple leaves, and a star in its heart, and its juice is as white as milk. Should\'st thou touch with this flower the hard lips of the Queen, she would follow thee all over the world. Out of the bed of the King she would rise, and over the whole world she would follow thee. And it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price. What d\'ye lack? What d\'ye lack? I can pound a toad in a mortar, and make broth of it, and stir the broth with a dead man\'s hand. Sprinkle it on thine enemy while he sleeps, and he will turn into a black viper, and hid own mother will slay him. With a wheel I can draw the Moon from heaven, and in a crystal I can show thee Death. What d\'ye lack? What d\'ye lack? Tell me thy desire, and I will give it thee, and thou shalt pay me a price, pretty boy, thou shalt pay me a price.\'\r\n\r\n\'My desire is but for a little thing,\' said the young Fisherman, \'yet hath the Priest been wroth with me, and driven me forth. It is but for a little thing, and the merchants have mocked at me, and denied me. Therefore am I come to thee, though men call thee evil, and whatever be thy price I shall pay it.\'\r\n\r\n\'What would\'st thou?\' asked the Witch, coming near to him.\r\n\r\n\'I would send my soul away from me,\' answered the young Fisherman.\r\n\r\nThe Witch grew pale, and shuddered, and hid her face in her blue mantle. \'Pretty boy, pretty boy,\' she muttered, \'that is a terrible thing to do.\'\r\n\r\nHe tossed his brown curls and laughed. \'My soul is nought to me,\' he answered. \'I cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it.\'\r\n\r\n\'What wilt thou give me if I tell thee?\' asked the Witch looking down at him with her beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Five pieces of gold,\' he said, \'and my nets, and the wattled house where I live, and the painted boat in which I sail. Only tell me how to get rid of my soul, and I will give thee all that I possess.\'\r\n\r\nShe laughed mockingly at him, and struck him with the spray of hemlock. \'I can turn the autumn leaves into gold,\' she answered, \'and I can weave the pale moonbeams into silver if I will it. He whom I serve is richer than all the kings of this world and has their dominions.\'\r\n\r\n\'What then shall I give thee,\' he cried, \'if thy price be neither gold nor silver?\'\r\n\r\nThe Witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand. \'Thou must dance with me, pretty boy,\' she murmured, and she smiled at him as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\'Nought but that?\' cried the young Fisherman in wonder, and he rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\'Nought but that,\' she answered, and she smiled at him again.\r\n\r\n\'Then at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together,\' he said, \'and after that we have danced thou shalt tell me the thing which I desire to know.\'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \'When the moon is full, when the moon is full,\' she muttered. Then she peered all round, and listened. A blue bird rose screaming from its nest and circled over the dunes, and three spotted birds rustled through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each other. There was no other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth pebbles below. So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and put her dry lips close to his ear.\r\n\r\n\'To-night thou must come to the top of the mountain,\' she whispered. \'It is a Sabbath, and He will be there.\'\r\n\r\nThe young Fisherman started and looked at her, and she showed her white teeth and laughed. \'Who is He of whom thou speakest?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'It matters not,\' she answered. \'Go thou to-night, and stand under the branches of the hornbeam, and wait for my coming. If a black dog run towards thee, strike it with a rod of willow, and it will go away. If an owl speak to thee, make it no answer. When the moon is full I shall be with thee, and we will dance together on the grass.\'\r\n\r\n\'But wilt thou swear to me to tell me how I may send my soul from me?\' he made question.\r\n\r\nShe moved out into the sunlight, and through her red hair rippled the wind. \'By the hoofs of the goat I swear it,\' she made answer.\r\n\r\n\'Thou art the best of the witches,\' cried the young Fisherman, \'and I will surely dance with thee to-night on the top of the mountain. I would indeed that thou hadst asked of me either gold or silver. But such as thy price is thou shalt have it, for it is but a little thing.\' And he doffed his cap to her, and bent his head low, and ran back to the town filled with a great joy.\r\n\r\nAnd the Witch watched him as he went, and when he had passed from her sight she entered her cave, and having taken a mirror from a box of carved cedarwood, she set it up on a frame, and burned vervain on lighted charcoal before it, and peered through the coils of the smoke. And after a time she clenched her hands in anger. \'He should have been mine,\' she muttered, \'I am as fair as she is.\'\r\n\r\nAnd that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up to the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam. Like a targe of polished metal the round sea lay at his feet, and the shadows of the fishing boats moved in the little bay. A great owl, with yellow sulphurous eyes, called to him by his name, but he made it no answer. A black dog ran towards him and snarled. He struck it with a rod of willow, and it went away whining.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the witches came flying through the air like bats. \'Phew!\' they cried, as they lit upon the ground, \'there is someone here we know not!\' and they sniffed about, and chattered to each other, and made signs. Last of all came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming in the wind. She wore a dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks\' eyes, and a little cap of green velvet was on her head.\r\n\r\n\'Where is he, where is he?\' shrieked the witches when they saw her, but she only laughed, and ran to the hornbeam, and taking the Fisherman by the hand she led him out into the moonlight and began to dance.\r\n\r\nRound and round they whirled, and the young Witch jumped so high that he could see the scarlet heels of her shoes. Then right across the dancers came the sound of the galloping of a horse, but no horse was to be seen, and he felt afraid.\r\n\r\n\'Faster,\' cried the Witch, and she threw her arms about his neck, and her breath was hot upon his face. \'Faster, faster!\' she cried, and the earth seemed to spin beneath his feet, and his brain grew troubled, and a great terror fell on him, as of some evil thing that was watching him, and at last he became aware that under the shadow of a rock there was a figure that had not been there before.\r\n\r\nIt was a man dressed in a suit of black velvet, cut in the Spanish fashion. His face was strangely pale, but his lips were like a proud red flower. He seemed weary, and was leaning back toying in a listless manner with the pommel of his dagger. On the grass beside him\' lay a plumed hat, and a pair of riding gloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and sewn with seed-pearls wrought into a curious device. A short cloak lined with sables hung from his shoulder, and his delicate white hands were gemmed with rings. Heavy eyelids drooped over his eyes. The young Fisherman watched him, as one snared in a spell. At last their eyes met, and wherever he danced it seemed to him that the eyes of the man were upon him. He heard the Witch laugh, and caught her by the waist, and whirled her madly round and round.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a dog bayed in the wood, and the dancers stopped, and going up two by two, knelt down, and kissed the man\'s hands. As they did so, a little smile touched his proud lips, as a bird\'s wing touches the water and makes it laugh. But there was disdain in it. He kept looking at the young Fisherman.\r\n\r\n\'Come! let us worship,\' whispered the Witch, and she led him up, and a great desire to do as she besought him seized on him, and he followed her. But when he came close, and without knowing why he did it, he made on his breast the sign of the Cross, and called upon the holy name.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew away, and the pallid face that had been watching him twitched with a spasm of pain. The man went over to a little wood, and whistled. A jennet with silver trappings came running to meet him. As he leapt upon the saddle he turned round, and looked at the young Fisherman sadly.\r\n\r\nAnd the Witch with the red hair tried to fly away also, but the Fisherman caught her by her wrists, and held her fast. \'Loose me,\' she cried, \'and let me go. For thou hast named what should not be named, and shown the sign that may not be looked at.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay,\' he answered, \'but I will not let thee go till thou hast told me the secret.\'\r\n\r\n\'What secret?\' said the Witch, wrestling with him like a wild cat, and biting her foam-flecked lips.\r\n\r\n\'Thou knowest,\' he made answer.\r\n\r\nHer grass-green eyes grew dim with tears, and she said to the Fisherman, \'Ask me anything but that!\'\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and held her all the more tightly.\r\n\r\nAnd when she saw that she could not free herself she whispered to him, \'Surely I am as fair as the daughters of the sea, and as comely as those that dwell in the blue waters,\' and she fawned on him and put her face close to his.\r\n\r\nBut he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, \'If thou keepest not the promise that thou madest to me I will slay thee for a false witch.\'\r\n\r\nShe grew grey as a blossom of the Judas tree, and shuddered. \'Be it so,\' she muttered. \'It is thy soul and not mine. Do with it as thou wilt.\' And she took from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green viper\'s skin, and gave it to him.\r\n\r\n\'What shall this serve me?\' he asked of her wondering.\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a few moments, and a look of terror came over her face. Then she brushed her hair back from her forehead, and smiling strangely she said to him, \'What men call the shadow of the body is not the shadow of the body, but is the body of the soul. Stand on the sea-shore with thy back to the moon, and cut away from around thy feet thy shadow, which is thy soul\'s body, and bid thy soul leave thee, and it will do so.\'\r\n\r\nThe young Fisherman trembled. \'Is this true?\' he murmured.\r\n\r\n\'It is true, and I would that I had not told thee of it,\' she cried, and she clung to his knees weeping.\r\n\r\nHe put her from him and left her in the rank grass, and going to the edge of the mountain he placed the knife in his belt, and began to climb down.\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul that was within him called out to him and said, \'Lo! I have dwelt with thee for all these years, and have been thy servant. Send me not away from thee now, for what evil have I done thee?\'\r\n\r\nAnd the young Fisherman laughed. \'Thou has done me no evil, but I have no need of thee,\' he answered. \'The world is wide, and there is Heaven also, and Hell, and that dim twilight house that lies between. Go wherever thou wilt, but trouble me not, for my love is calling to me.\'\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul besought him piteously, but he heeded it not, but leapt from crag to crag, being sure-footed as a wild goat, and at last he reached the level ground and the yellow shore of the sea.\r\n\r\nBronze-limbed and well-knit, like a statue wrought by a Grecian, he stood on the sand with his back to the moon, and out of the foam came white arms that beckoned to him, and out of the waves rose dim forms that did him homage. Before him lay his shadow, which was the body of his soul, and behind him hung the moon in the honey-coloured air.\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul said to him, \'If indeed thou must drive me from thee, send me not forth without a heart. The world is cruel, give me thy heart to take with me.\'\r\n\r\nHe tossed his head and smiled. \'With what should I love my love if I gave thee my heart?\' he cried.\r\n\r\n\'Nay, but be merciful,\' said his Soul: \'give me thy heart, for the world is very cruel, and I am afraid.\'\r\n\r\n\'My heart is my love\'s,\' he answered, \'therefore tarry not, but get thee gone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Should I not love also?\' asked his Soul.\r\n\r\n\'Get thee gone, for I have no need of thee,\' cried the young Fisherman, and he took the little knife with its handle of green viper\'s skin, and cut away his shadow from around his feet, and it rose up and stood before him, and looked at him, and it was even as himself.\r\n\r\nHe crept back, and thrust the knife into his belt, and a feeling of awe came over him. \'Get thee gone,\' he murmured, \'and let me see thy face no more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, but we must meet again,\' said the Soul. Its voice was low and flute-like, and its lips hardly moved while it spake.\r\n\r\n\'How shall we meet?\' cried the young Fisherman. \'Thou wilt not follow me into the depths of the sea?\'\r\n\r\n\'Once every year I will come to this place, and call to thee,\' said the Soul. \'It may be that thou wilt have need of me.\'\r\n\r\n\'What need should I have of thee?\' cried the young Fisherman, \'but be it as thou wilt,\' and he plunged into the water, and the Tritons blew their horns, and the little Mermaid rose up to meet him, and put her arms around his neck and kissed him on the mouth.\r\n\r\nAnd the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them. And when they had sunk down into the sea, it went weeping away over the marshes.\r\n\r\nAnd after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep, and said, \'Why dost thou call to me?\'\r\n\r\nAnd the Soul answered, \'Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have seen marvellous things.\'\r\n\r\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head upon his hand and listened.\r\n\r\nAnd the Soul said to him, \'When I left thee I turned my face to the East and journeyed. From the East cometh everything that is wise. Six days I journeyed, and on the morning of the seventh day I came to a hill that is in the country of the Tartars. I sat down under the shade of a tamarisk tree to shelter myself from the sun. The land was dry, and burnt up with the heat. The people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling upon a disk of polished copper.\r\n\r\n\'When it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim of the land. When the Tartars saw it, they strung their painted bows, and having leapt upon their little horses they galloped to meet it. The women fled screaming to the waggons, and hid themselves behind the felt curtains.\r\n\r\n\'At twilight the Tartars returned, but five of them were missing, and of those that came back not a few had been wounded. They harnessed their horses to the waggons and drove hastily away. Three jackals came out of a cave and peered after them. Then they sniffed up the air with their nostrils, and trotted off in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n\'When the moon rose I saw a camp-fire burning on the plain, and went towards it. A company of merchants were seated round it on carpets. Their camels were picketed behind them, and the negroes who were their servants were pitching tents of tanned skin upon the sand, and making a high wall of the prickly pear.\r\n\r\n\'As I came near them, the chief of the merchants rose up and drew his sword, and asked me my business.\r\n\r\n\'I answered that I was a Prince in my own land, and that I had escaped from the Tartars, who had sought to make me their slave. The chief smiled, and showed me five heads fixed upon long reeds of bamboo.\r\n\r\n\'Then he asked me who was the prophet of God, and I answered him Mohammed.\r\n\r\n\'When he heard the name of the false prophet, he bowed and took me by the hand, and placed me by his side. A negro brought me some mare\'s milk in a wooden-dish, and a piece of lamb\'s flesh roasted.\r\n\r\n\'At daybreak we started on our journey. I rode on a red-haired camel by the side of the chief, and a runner ran before us carrying a spear. The men of war were on either hand, and the mules followed with the merchandise. There were forty camels in the caravan, and the mules were twice forty in number.\r\n\r\n\'We went from the country of the Tartars into the country of those who curse the Moon. We saw the Gryphons guarding their gold on the white rocks, and the scaled Dragons sleeping in their caves. As we passed over the mountains we held our breath lest the snows might fall on us, and each man tied a veil of gauze before his eyes. As we passed through the valleys the Pygmies shot arrows at us from the hollows of the trees, and at night time we heard the wild men beating on their drums. When we came to the Tower of Apes we set fruits before them, and they did not harm us. When we came to the Tower of Serpents we gave them warm milk in bowls of brass, and they let us go by. Three times in our journey we came to the banks of the Oxus. We crossed it on rafts of wood with great bladders of blown hide. The river-horses raged against us and sought to slay us. When the camels saw them they trembled.\r\n\r\n\'The kings of each city levied tolls on us, but would not suffer us to enter their gates. They threw us bread over the walls, little maize-cakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates. For every hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber.\r\n\r\n\'When the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned the wells and fled to the hill-summits. We fought with the Magadae who are born old, and grow younger and younger every year, and die when they are little children; and with the Laktroi who say that they are the sons of tigers, and paint themselves yellow and black; and with the Aurantes who bury their dead on the tops of trees, and themselves live in dark caverns lest the Sun, who is their god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians who worship a crocodile, and give it earrings of green glass, and feed it with butter and fresh fowls; and with the Agazonbae, who are dog-faced; and with the Sibans, who have horses\' feet, and run more swiftly than horses. A third of our company died in battle, and a third died of want. The rest murmured against me, and said that I had brought them an evil fortune. I took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me. When they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid.\r\n\r\n\'In the fourth month we reached the city of Illel. It was night time when we came to the grove that is outside the walls, and the air was sultry, for the Moon was travelling in Scorpion. We took the ripe pomegranates from the trees, and brake them and drank their sweet juices. Then we lay down on our carpets and waited for the dawn.\r\n\r\n\'And at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city. It was wrought out of red bronze, and carved with sea-dragons and dragons that have wings. The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our business. The interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from the island of Syria with much merchandise. They took hostages, and told us that they would open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till then.\r\n\r\n\'When it was noon they opened the gate, and as we entered in the people came crowding out of the houses to look at us, and a crier went round the city crying through a shell. We stood in the market-place, and the negroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests of sycamore. And when they had ended their task, the merchants set forth their strange wares, the waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen from the country of the Ethiops, the purple sponges from Tyre and the blue hangings from Sidon, the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of glass and the curious vessels of burnt clay. From the roof of a house a company of women watched us. One of them wore a mask of gilded leather.\r\n\r\n\'And on the first day the priests came and bartered with us, and on the second day came the nobles, and on the third day came the craftsmen and the slaves. And this is their custom with all merchants as long as they tarry in the city.\r\n\r\n\'And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and wandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of its god. The priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the green trees, and on a pavement of black marble stood the rose-red house in which the god had his dwelling. Its doors were of powdered lacquer, and bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold. The tiled roof was of sea-green porcelain, and the jutting eaves were festooned with little bells. When the white doves flew past, they struck the bells with their wings and made them tinkle.\r\n\r\n\'In front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx. I lay down beside it, and with my pale fingers I touched the broad leaves. One of the priests came towards me and stood behind me. He had sandals on his feet, one of soft serpent-skin and the other of birds\' plumage. On his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver crescents. Seven yellows were woven into his robe, and his frizzed hair was stained with antimony.\r\n\r\n\'After a little while he spake to me, and asked me my desire. \'I told him that my desire was to see the god.\r\n\r\n\'\"The god is hunting,\" said the priest, looking strangely at me with his small slanting eyes.\r\n\r\n\'\"Tell me in what forest, and I will ride with him,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\'He combed out the soft fringes of his tunic with his long pointed nails. \"The god is asleep,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\n\'\"Tell me on what couch, and I will watch by him,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\'\"The god is at the feast,\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\'\"If the wine be sweet I will drink it with him, and if it be bitter I will drink it with him also,\" was my answer.\r\n\r\n\'He bowed his head in wonder, and, taking me by the hand, he raised me up, and led me into the temple.\r\n\r\n\'And in the first chamber I saw an idol seated on a throne of jasper bordered with great orient pearls. It was carved out of ebony, and in stature was of the stature of a man. On its forehead was a ruby, and thick oil dripped from its hair on to its thighs. Its feet were red with the blood of a newly-slain kid, and its loins girt with a copper belt that was studded with seven beryls.\r\n\r\n\'And I said to the priest, \"Is this the god?\" And he answered me, \"This is the god.\"\r\n\r\n\'\"Show me the god,\" I cried, \"or I will surely slay thee.\" And I touched his hand, and it became withered.\r\n\r\n\'And the priest besought me, saying, \"Let my lord heal his servant, and I will show him the god.\"\r\n\r\n\'So I breathed with my breath upon his hand, and it became whole again, and he trembled and led me into the second chamber, and I saw an idol standing on a lotus of jade hung with great emeralds. It was carved out of ivory, and in stature was twice the stature of a man. On its forehead was a chrysolite, and its breasts were smeared with myrrh and cinnamon. In one hand it held a crooked sceptre of jade, and in the other a round crystal. It ware buskins of brass, and its thick neck was circled with a circle of selenites.\r\n\r\n\'And I said to the priest, \"Is this the god?\" And he answered me. \"This is the god.\"\r\n\r\n\'\"Show me the god,\" I cried, \"or I will surely slay thee.\" And I touched his eyes, and they became blind.\r\n\r\n\'And the priest besought me, saying, \"Let my lord heal his servant, and I will show him the god.\"\r\n\r\n\'So I breathed with my breath upon his eyes, and the sight came back to them, and he trembled again, and led me into the third chamber, and lo! there was no idol in it, nor image of any kind, but only a mirror of round metal set on an altar of stone.\r\n\r\n\'And I said to the priest, \"Where is the god?\"\r\n\r\n\'And he answered me: \"There is no god but this mirror that thou seest, for this is the Mirror of Wisdom. And it reflecteth all things that are in heaven and on earth, save only the face of him who looketh into it. This it reflecteth not, so that he who looketh into it may be wise. Many other mirrors are there, but they are mirrors of Opinion. This only is the Mirror of Wisdom. And they who possess this mirror know everything, nor is there anything hidden from them. And they who possess it not have not Wisdom. Therefore is it the god, and we worship it.\" And I looked into the mirror, and it was even as I he had said to me.\r\n\r\n\'And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a valley that is but a day\'s journey from this place have I hidden the Mirror of Wisdom. Do but suffer me to enter into thee again and be thy servant, and thou shalt be wiser than all the wise men, and Wisdom shall be thine. Suffer me to enter into thee, and none will be as wise as thou.\' But the young Fisherman laughed. \'Love is better than Wisdom,\' he cried, \'and the little Mermaid loves me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, but there is nothing better than Wisdom,\' said the Soul.\r\n\r\n\'Love is better,\' answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the deep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.\r\n\r\nAnd after the second year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and said, \'Why dost thou call to me?\'\r\n\r\nAnd the Soul answered, \'Come nearer that I may speak with thee, for I have seen marvellous things.\'\r\n\r\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head upon his hand and listened.\r\n\r\nAnd the Soul said to him, \'When I left thee, I turned my face to the South and journeyed. From the South cometh every thing that is precious. Six days I journeyed along the highways that lead to the city of Ashter, along the dusty red-dyed highways by which the pilgrims are wont to go did I journey, and on the morning of the seventh day I lifted up my eyes, and lo! the city lay at my feet, for it is in a valley.\r\n\r\n\'There are nine gates to this city, and in front of each gate stands a bronze horse that neighs when the Bedouins come down from the mountains. The walls are cased with copper, and the watch-towers on the walls are roofed with brass. In every tower stands an archer with a bow in his hand. At sunrise he strikes with an arrow on a gong, and at sunset he blows through a horn of horn.\r\n\r\n\'When I sought to enter, the guards stopped me and asked of me who I was. I made answer that I was a Dervish and on my way to the city of Mecca, where there was a green veil on which the Koran was embroidered in silver letters by the hands of the angels. They were filled with wonder, and entreated me to pass in.\r\n\r\n\'Inside it is even as a bazaar. Surely thou should\'st have been with me. Across the narrow streets the gay lanterns of paper flutter like large butterflies. When the wind blows over the roofs they rise and fall as painted bubbles do. In front of their booths sit the merchants on silken carpets. They have straight black beards, and their turbans are covered with golden sequins, and long strings of amber and carved peach-stones glide through their cool fingers. Some of them sell galbanum and nard, and curious perfumes from the islands of the Indian Sea, and the thick oil of red roses and myrrh and little nail-shaped cloves. When one stops to speak to them, they throw pinches of frankincense upon a charcoal brazier and make the air sweet. I saw a Syrian who held in his hands a thin rod like a reed. Grey threads of smoke came from it, and its odour as it burned was as the odour of the pink almond in spring. Others sell silver bracelets embossed all over with creamy blue turquoise stones, and anklets of brass wire fringed with little pearls, and tigers\' claws set in gold, and the claws of that gilt cat, the leopard, set in gold also, and earrings of pierced emerald, and finger-rings of hollowed jade. From the tea-houses comes the sound of the guitar, and the opium-smokers with their white smiling faces look out at the passers-by.\r\n\r\n\'Of a truth thou should\'st have been with me. The wine-sellers elbow their way through the crowd with great black skins on their shoulders. Most of them sell the wine of Schiraz, which is as sweet as honey. They serve it in little metal cups and strew rose leaves upon it. In the market-place stand the fruitsellers, who sell all kinds of fruit: ripe figs, with their bruised purple flesh, melons, smelling of musk and yellow as topazes, citrons and rose-apples and clusters of white grapes, round red-gold oranges, and oval lemons of green gold. Once I saw an elephant go by. Its trunk was painted with vermilion and turmeric, and over its ears it had a net of crimson silk cord. It stopped opposite one of the booths and began eating the oranges, and the man only laughed. Thou canst not think how strange a people they are. When they are glad they go to the bird-sellers and buy of them a caged bird, and set it free that their joy may be greater, and when they are sad they scourge themselves with thorns that their sorrow may not grow less.\r\n\r\n\'One evening I met some negroes carrying a heavy palanquin through the bazaar. It was made of gilded bamboo, and the poles were of vermilion lacquer studded with brass peacocks. Across the windows hung thin curtains of muslim embroidered with beetles\' wings and with tiny seed-pearls, and as it passed by a pale-faced Circassian looked out and smiled at me. I followed behind, and the negroes hurried their steps and scowled. But I did not care. I felt a great curiosity come over me.\r\n\r\n\'At last they stopped at a square white house. There were no windows to it, only a little door like the door of a tomb. They set down the palanquin and knocked three times with a copper hammer. An Armenian in a caftan of green leather peered through the wicket, and when he saw them he opened, and spread a carpet on the ground, and the woman stepped out. As she went in, she turned round and smiled at me again. I had never seen anyone so pale.\r\n\r\n\'When the moon rose I returned to the same place and sought for the house, but it was no longer there. When I saw that, I knew who the woman was, and wherefore she had smiled at me.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly thou should\'st have been with me. On the feast of the New Moon the young Emperor came forth from his palace and went into the mosque to pray. His hair and beard were dyed with rose-leaves, and his cheeks were powdered with a fine gold dust. The palms of his feet and hands were yellow with saffron.\r\n\r\n\'At sunrise he went forth from his palace in a robe of silver, and at sunset he returned to it again in a robe of gold. The people flung themselves on the ground and hid their faces, but I would not do so. I stood by the stall of a seller of dates and waited. When the Emperor saw me, he raised his painted eyebrows and stopped. I stood quite still, and made him no obeisance. The people marvelled at my boldness, and counsel-led me to flee from the city. I paid no heed to them, but went and sat with the sellers of strange gods, who by reason of their craft are abominated. When I told them what I had done, each of them gave me a god and prayed me to leave them.\r\n\r\n\'That night, as I lay on a cushion in the tea-house that is in the Street of Pomegranates, the guards of the Emperor entered and led me to the palace. As I went in they closed each door behind me, and put a chain across it. Inside was a great court with an arcade running all round. The walls were of white alabaster, set here and there with blue and green tiles. The pillars were of green marble, and the pavement of a kind of peach-blossom marble. I had never seen anything like it before.\r\n\r\n\'As I passed across the court two veiled women looked down from a balcony and cursed me. The guards hastened on, and the butts of the lances rang upon the polished floor. They opened a gate of wrought ivory, and I found myself in a watered garden of seven terraces. It was planted with tulip-cups and moonflowers, and silver-studded aloes. Like a slim reed of crystal a fountain hung in the dusky air. The cypress-trees were like burnt-out torches. From one of them a nightingale was singing.\r\n\r\n\'At the end of the garden stood a little pavilion. As we approached it two eunuchs came out to meet us. Their fat bodies swayed as they walked, and they glanced curiously at me with their yellow-lidded eyes. One of them drew aside the captain of the guard, and in a low voice whispered to him. The other kept munching scented pastilles, which he took with an affected gesture out of an oval box of lilac enamel.\r\n\r\n\'After a few moments the captain of the guard dismissed the soldiers. They went back to the palace, the eunuchs following slowly behind and plucking the sweet mulberries from the trees as they passed. Once the elder of the two turned round, and smiled at me with an evil smile.\r\n\r\n\'Then the captain of the guard motioned me towards the entrance of the pavilion. I walked on without trembling, and drawing the heavy curtain aside I entered in.\r\n\r\n\'The young Emperor was stretched on a couch of dyed lion skins, and a ger-falcon perched upon his wrist. Behind him stood a brass-turbaned Nubian, naked down to the waist, and with heavy earrings in his split ears. On a table by the side of the couch lay a mighty scimitar of steel.\r\n\r\n\'When the Emperor saw me he frowned, and said to me, \"What is thy name? Knowest thou not that I am Emperor of this city?\" But I made him no answer.\r\n\r\n\'He pointed with his finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian seized it, and rushing forward struck at me with great violence. The blade whizzed through me, and did me no hurt. The man fell sprawling on the floor, and, when he rose up, his teeth chattered with terror and he hid himself behind the couch.\r\n\r\n\'The Emperor leapt to his feet, and taking a lance from a stand of arms, he threw it at me. I caught it in its flight, and brake the shaft into two pieces. He shot at me with an arrow, but I held up my hands and it stopped in mid-air. Then he drew a dagger from a belt of white leather, and stabbed the Nubian in the throat lest the slave should tell of his dishonour. The man writhed like a trampled snake, and a red foam bubbled from his lips.\r\n\r\n\'As soon as he was dead the Emperor turned to me, and when he had wiped away the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled and purple silk, he said to me, \"Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm thee, or the son of a prophet that I can do thee no hurt? I pray thee leave my city to night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its lord.\"\r\n\r\n\'And I answered him, \"I will go for half of thy treasure. Give me half of thy treasure, and I will go away.\"\r\n\r\n\'He took me by the hand, and led me out into the garden. When the captain of the guard saw me, he wondered. When the eunuchs saw me, their knees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear.\r\n\r\n\'There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry, and a brass-scaled ceiling hung with lamps. The Emperor touched one of the walls and it opened, and we passed down a corridor that was lit with many torches. In niches upon each side stood great wine-jars filled to the brim with silver pieces. When we reached the centre of the corridor the Emperor spake the word that may not be spoken, and a granite door swung back on a secret spring, and he put his hands before his face lest his eyes should be dazzled.\r\n\r\n\'Thou could\'st not believe how marvellous a place it was. There were huge tortoise-shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size piled up with red rubies. The gold was stored in coffers of elephant-hide, and the gold-dust in leather bottles. There were opals and sapphires, the former in cups of crystal, and the latter in cups of jade. Round green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of ivory, and in one corner were silk bags filled, some with turquoise-stones and others with beryls. The ivory horns were heaped with purple amethysts, and the horns of brass with chalcedonies and sards. The pillars, which were of cedar, were hung with strings of yellow lynx-stones. In the flat oval shields there were carbuncles, both wine-coloured and coloured like grass. And yet I have told thee but a tithe of what was there.\r\n\r\n\'And when the Emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he said to me: \"This is my house of treasure, and half that is in it is thine, even as I promised to thee. And I will give thee camels and camel drivers, and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure to whatever part of the world thou desirest to go. And the thing shall be done to night, for I would not that the Sun, who is my father, should see that there is in my city a man whom I cannot slay.\"\r\n\r\n\'But I answered him, \"The gold that is here is thine, and the silver also is thine, and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price. As for me, I have no need of these. Nor shall I take aught from thee but that little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand.\"\r\n\r\n\'And the Emperor frowned. \"It is but a ring of lead,\" he cried, \"nor has it any value. Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my city.\"\r\n\r\n\'\"Nay,\" I answered, \"but I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I know what is written within it, and for what purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\'And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, \"Take all the treasure and go from my city. The half that is mine shall be thine also.\"\r\n\r\n\'And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a cave that is but a day\'s journey from this place have I hidden the Ring of Riches. It is but a day\'s journey from this place, and it waits for thy coming. He who has this Ring is richer than all the kings of the world. Come therefore and take it, and the world\'s riches shall be thine.\'\r\n\r\nBut the young Fisherman laughed. \'Love is better than Riches,\' he cried, \'and the little Mermaid loves me.\r\n\r\n\'Nay, but there is nothing better than Riches,\' said the Soul.\r\n\r\n\'Love is better,\' answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the deep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.\r\n\r\nAnd after the third year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of the sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and said, \'Why dost thou call to me?\'\r\n\r\nAnd the Soul answered, \'Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have seen marvellous things.\'\r\n\r\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head upon his hand and listened.\r\n\r\nAnd the Soul said to him, \'In a city that I know of there is an inn that standeth by a river. I sat there with sailors who drank of two different coloured wines, and ate bread made of barley, and little salt fish served in bay leaves with vinegar. And as we sat and made merry, there entered to us an old man bearing a leathern carpet and a lute that had two horns of amber. And when he had laid out the carpet on the floor, he struck with a quill on the wire strings of his lute, and a girl whose face was veiled ran in and began to dance before us. Her face was veiled with a veil of gauze, but her feet were naked. Naked were her feet, and they moved over the carpet like little white pigeons. Never have I seen anything so marvellous, and the city in which she dances is but a day\'s journey from this place.\'\r\n\r\nNow when the young Fisherman heard the words of his soul, he remembered that the little Mermaid had no feet and could not dance. And a great desire came over him, and he said to himself, \'It is but a day\'s journey, and I can return to my love,\' and he laughed, and stood up in the shallow water, and strode towards the shore.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had reached the dry shore he laughed again, and held out his arms to his Soul. And his Soul gave a great cry of joy and ran to meet him, and entered into him, and the young Fisherman saw stretched before him upon the sand that shadow of the body that is the body of the Soul.\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul said to him, \'Let us not tarry, but get hence at once, for the Sea-gods are jealous, and have monsters that do their bidding.\'\r\n\r\nSo they made haste, and all that night they journeyed beneath the moon, and all the next day they journeyed beneath the sun, and on the evening of the day they came to a city.\r\n\r\nAnd the young Fisherman said to his Soul, \'Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou did\'st speak to me?\'\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul answered him, \'It is not this city, but another. Nevertheless let us enter in.\'\r\n\r\nSo they entered in and passed through the streets, and as they passed through the Street of the Jewellers the young fisherman saw a fair silver cup set forth in a booth. And his Soul said to him, \'Take that silver cup and hide it.\'\r\n\r\nSo he took the cup and hid it in the fold of his tunic, and they went hurriedly out of the city.\r\n\r\nAnd after that they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman frowned, and flung the cup away, and said to his Soul, \'Why did\'st thou tell me to take this cup and hide it, for it was an evil thing to do?\'\r\n\r\nBut his Soul answered him, \'Be at peace, be at peace.\'\r\n\r\nAnd on the evening of the second day they came to a city, and the young Fisherman said to his Soul, \'Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou did\'st speak to me?\'\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul answered him, \'It is not this city, but another. Nevertheless let us enter in.\'\r\n\r\nSo they entered in and passed through the streets, and as they passed through the Street of the Sellers of Sandals, the young Fisherman saw a child standing by a jar of water. And his Soul said to him, \'Smite that child.\' So he smote the child till it wept, and when he had done this they went hurriedly out of the city.\r\n\r\nAnd after that they had gone a league from the city the young Fisherman grew wroth, and said to his Soul, \'Why did\'st thou tell me to smite the child, for it was an evil thing to do?\'\r\n\r\nBut his Soul answered him, \'Be at peace, be at peace.\'\r\n\r\nAnd on the evening of the third day they came to a city, and the young Fisherman said to his Soul, \'Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou did\'st speak to me?\'\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul answered him, \'It may be that it is this city, therefore let us enter in.\'\r\n\r\nSo they entered in and passed through the streets, but nowhere could the young Fisherman find the river or the inn that stood by its side. And the people of the city looked curiously at him, and he grew afraid and said to his Soul, \'Let us go hence, for she who dances with white feet is not here.\'\r\n\r\nBut his Soul answered, \'Nay, but let us tarry, for the night is dark and there will be robbers on the way.\'\r\n\r\nSo he sat him down in the market-place and rested, and after a time there went by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of Tartary, and bare a lantern of pierced horn at the end of a jointed reed. And the merchant said to him, \'Why dost thou sit in the market-place, seeing that the booths are closed and the bales corded?\'\r\n\r\nAnd the young Fisherman answered him, \'I can find no inn in this city, nor have I any kinsman who might give me shelter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are we not all kinsmen?\' said the merchant. \'And did not one God make us? Therefore come with me, for I have a guest-chamber.\'\r\n\r\nSo the young Fisherman rose up and followed the merchant to his house. And when he had passed through a garden of pomegranates and entered into the house, the merchant brought him rose-water in a copper dish that he might wash his hands, and ripe melons that he might quench his thirst, and set a bowl of rice and a piece of roasted kid before him.\r\n\r\nAnd after that he had finished, the merchant led him to the guest-chamber, bade him sleep and be at rest. And the young Fisherman gave him thanks, and kissed the ring that was on his hand, and flung himself down on the carpets of dyed goat\'s-hair. And when he had covered himself with a covering of black lambs-wool he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nAnd three hours before dawn, and while it was still night, his Soul waked him, and said to him, \'Rise up and go to the room of the merchant, even to the room in which he sleepeth, and slay him, and take from him his gold, for we have need of it.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the young Fisherman rose up and crept towards the room of the merchant, and over the feet of the merchant there was lying a curved sword, and the tray by the side of the merchant held nine purses of gold. And he reached out his hand and touched the sword, and when he touched it the merchant started and awoke, and leaping up seized himself the sword and cried to the young Fisherman, \'Dost thou return evil for good, and pay with the shedding of blood for the kindness that I have shown thee?\'\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul said to the young Fisherman, \'Strike him,\' and he struck him so that he swooned, and he seized then the nine purses of gold, and fled hastily through the garden of pomegranates, and set his face to the star that is the star of morning.\r\n\r\nAnd when they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman beat his breast, and said to his Soul, \'Why didst thou bid me slay the merchant and take his gold? Surely thou art evil.\'\r\n\r\nBut his Soul answered him, \'Be at peace, be at peace.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay,\' cried the young Fisherman, \'I may not be at peace, for all that thou hast made me to do I hate. Thee also I hate, and I bid thee tell me wherefore thou hast wrought with me in this wise.\'\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul answered him, \'When thou didst send me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart, so I learned to do all these things and love them.\'\r\n\r\n\'What sayest thou?\' murmured the young Fisherman.\r\n\r\n\'Thou knowest,\' answered his Soul, \'thou knowest it well. Hast thou forgotten that thou gavest me no heart? I trow not. And so trouble not thyself nor me, but be at peace, for there is no pain that thou shalt not give away, nor any pleasure that thou shalt not receive.\'\r\n\r\nAnd when the young Fisherman heard these words he trembled and said to his Soul, \'Nay, but thou art evil, and hast made me forget my love, and hast tempted me with temptations, and hast set my feet in the ways of sin.\' And his Soul answered him, \'Thou hast not forgotten that when thou didst send me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart. Come, let us go to another city, and make merry, for we have nine purses of gold.\'\r\n\r\nBut the young Fisherman took the nine purses of gold, and flung them down, and trampled on them.\r\n\r\n\'Nay,\' he cried, \'but I will have nought to do with thee, nor will I journey with thee anywhere, but even as I sent thee away before, so will I send thee away now, for thou hast wrought me no good.\' And he turned his back to the moon, and with the little knife that had the handle of green viper\'s skin he strove to cut from his feet that shadow of the body which is the body of the Soul.\r\n\r\nYet his Soul stirred not from him, nor paid heed to his command, but said to him, \'The spell that the Witch told thee avails thee no more, for I may not leave thee, nor mayest thou drive me forth. Once in his life may a man send his Soul away, but he who receiveth back his Soul must keep it with him for ever, and this is his punishment and his reward.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the young Fisherman grew pale and clenched his hands and cried, \'She was a false Witch in that she told me not that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay,\' answered his Soul, \'but she was true to Him she worships, and whose servant she will be ever.\'\r\n\r\nAnd when the young Fisherman knew that he could no longer get rid of his Soul, and that it was an evil Soul and would abide with him always, he fell upon the ground weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\nAnd when it was day the young Fisherman rose up and said to his Soul, \'I will bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, and close my lips that I may not speak thy words, and I will return to the place where she whom I love has her dwelling. Even to the sea will I return, and to the little bay where she is wont to sing, and I will call to her and tell her the evil I have done and the evil thou hast wrought on me.\'\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul tempted him and said, \'Who is thy love that thou should\'st return to her? The world has many fairer than she is. There are the dancing-girls of Samaris who dance in the manner of all kinds of birds and beasts. Their feet are painted with henna, and in their hands they have little copper bells. They laugh while they dance, and their laughter is as clear as the laughter of water. Come with me and I will show them to thee. For what is this trouble of thine about the things of sin? Is that which is pleasant to eat not made for the eater? Is there poison in that which is sweet to drink? Trouble not thyself, but come with me to another city. There is a little city hard by in which there is a garden of tulip-trees. And there dwell in this comely garden white peacocks and peacocks that have blue breasts. Their tails when they spread them to the sun are like disks of ivory and like gilt disks. And she who feeds them dances for their pleasure, and sometimes she dances on her hands and at other times she dances with her feet. Her eyes are coloured with stibium, and her nostrils are shaped like the wings of a swallow. From a hook in one of her nostrils hangs a flower that is carved out of a pearl. She laughs while she dances, and the silver rings that are about her ankles tinkle like bells of silver. And so trouble not thyself any more, but come with me to this city.\'\r\n\r\nBut the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but closed his lips with the seal of silence and with a tight cord bound his hands, and journeyed back to the place from which he had come, even to the little bay where his love had been wont to sing. And ever did his Soul tempt him by the way, but he made it no answer, nor would he do any of the wickedness that it sought to make him to do, so great was the power of the love that was within him.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had reached the shore of the sea, he loosed the cord from his hands, and took the seal of silence from his lips, and called to the little Mermaid. But she came not to his call, though he called to her all day long and besought her.\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul mocked him and said, \'Surely thou hast but little joy out of thy love. Thou art as one who in time of dearth pours water into a broken vessel. Thou givest away what thou hast, and nought is given to thee in return. It were better for thee to come with me, for I know where the Valley of Pleasure lies, and what things are wrought there.\'\r\n\r\nBut the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but in a cleft of the rock he built himself a house of wattles, and abode there for the space of a year. And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again and at night-time he spake her name. Yet never did she rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her, though he sought for her in the caves and in the green water, in the pools of the tide and in the wells that are at the bottom of the deep.\r\n\r\nAnd ever did his Soul tempt him with evil, and whisper of terrible things. Yet did it not prevail against him, so great was the power of his love.\r\n\r\nAnd after the year was over, the Soul thought within himself, \'I have tempted my master with evil, and his love is stronger than I am. I will tempt him now with good, and it may be that he will come with me.\'\r\n\r\nSo he spake to the young Fisherman and said, \'I have told thee of the joy of the world, and thou hast turned a deaf ear to me. Suffer me now to tell thee of the world\'s pain, and it may be that thou wilt hearken. For of a truth, pain is the Lord of this world, nor is there anyone who escapes from its net. There be some who lack raiment, and others who lack bread. There be widows who sit in purple, and widows who sit in rags. To and fro over the fens go the lepers, and they are cruel to each other. The beggars go up and down on the highways, and their wallets are empty. Through the streets of the cities walks Famine, and the Plague sits at their gates. Come, let us go forth and mend these things, and make them not to be. Wherefore should\'st thou tarry here calling to thy love, seeing she comes not to thy call? And what is love, that thou should\'st set this high store upon it?\'\r\n\r\nBut the young Fisherman answered it nought, so great was the power of his love. And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night-time he spake her name. Yet never did she rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her, though he sought for her in the rivers of the sea, and in the valleys that are under the waves, in the sea that the night makes purple, and in the sea that the dawn leaves grey.\r\n\r\nAnd after the second year was over, the Soul said to the young Fisherman at night-time, and as he sat in the wattled house alone, \'Lo! now I have tempted thee with evil, and I have tempted thee with good, and thy love is stronger than I am. Wherefore will I tempt thee no longer, but I pray thee to suffer me to enter thy heart, that I may be one with thee even as before.\'\r\n\r\n\'Surely thou mayest enter,\' said the young Fisherman, \'for in the days when with no heart thou didst go through the world thou must have much suffered.\'\r\n\r\n\'Alas!\' cried his Soul, \'I can find no place of entrance, so compassed about with love is this heart of thine.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yet I would that I could help thee,\' said the young Fisherman.\r\n\r\nAnd as he spake there came a great cry of mourning from the sea, even the cry that men hear when one of the Sea-folk is dead. And the young Fisherman leapt up, and left his wattled house, and ran down to the shore. And the black waves came hurrying to the shore, bearing with them a burden that was whiter than silver. White as the surf it was, and like a flower it tossed on the waves. And the surf took it from the waves, and the foam took it from the surf, and the shore received it, and lying at his feet the young Fisherman saw the body of the little Mermaid. Dead at his feet it was lying.\r\n\r\nWeeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside it, and he kissed the cold red of the mouth, and toyed with the wet amber of the hair. He flung himself down beside it on the sand, weeping as one trembling with joy, and in his brown arms he held it to his breast. Cold were the lips, yet he kissed them. Salt was the honey of the hair, yet he tasted it with a bitter joy. He kissed the closed eyelids, and the wild spray that lay upon their cups was less salt than his tears.\r\n\r\nAnd to the dead thing he made confession. Into the shells of its ears he poured the harsh wine of his tale. He put the little hands round his neck, and with his fingers he touched the thin reed of the throat. Bitter, bitter was his joy, and full of strange gladness was his pain.\r\n\r\nThe black sea came nearer, and the white foam moaned like a leper. With white claws of foam the sea grabbled at the shore. From the palace of the Sea-King came the cry of mourning again, and far out upon the sea the great Tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns.\r\n\r\n\'Flee away, said his Soul, \'for ever doth the sea come nigher, and if thou tarriest it will slay thee. Flee away, for I am afraid, seeing that thy heart is closed against me by reason of the greatness of thy love. Flee away to a place of safety. Surely thou wilt not send me without a heart into another world?\'\r\n\r\nBut the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on the little Mermaid and said, \'Love is better than wisdom, and more precious than riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men. The fires cannot destroy it, nor can the waters quench it. I called on thee at dawn, and thou didst not come to my call. The moon heard thy name, yet hadst thou no heed of me. For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt had I wandered away. Yet ever did thy love abide with me, and ever was it strong, nor did aught prevail against it, though I have looked upon evil and looked upon good. And now that thou art dead, surely I will die with thee also.\'\r\n\r\nAnd his Soul besought him to depart, but he would not, so great was his love. And the sea came nearer, and sought to cover him with its waves, and when he knew that the end was at hand he kissed with mad lips the cold lips of the Mermaid and the heart that was within him brake. And as through the fulness of his love his heart did break, the Soul found an entrance and entered in, and was one with him even as before. And the sea covered the young Fisherman with its waves.\r\n\r\nAnd in the morning the Priest went forth to bless the sea, for it had been troubled. And with him went the monks and the musicians, and the candle-bearers, and the swingers of censers, and a great company.\r\n\r\nAnd when the Priest reached the shore he saw the young Fisherman lying drowned in the surf, and clasped in his arms was the body of the little Mermaid. And he drew back frowning, and having made the sign of the cross, he cried aloud and said, \'I will not bless the sea nor anything that is in it. Accursed be the Sea-folk, and accursed be all they who traffic with them. And as for him who for love\'s sake forsook God, and so lieth here with his leman slain by God\'s judgment, take up his body and the body of his leman, and bury them in the corner of the Field of the Fullers, and set no mark above them, nor sign of any kind, that none may know the place of their resting. For accursed were they in their lives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the people did as he commanded them, and in the corner of the Field of the Fullers, where no sweet herbs grew, they dug a deep pit, and laid the dead things within it.\r\n\r\nAnd when the third year was over, and on a day that was a holy day, the Priest went up to the chapel, that he might show to the people the wounds of the Lord, and speak to them about the wrath of God.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had robed himself with his robes, and entered in and bowed himself before the altar, he saw that the altar was covered with strange flowers that never had he seen before. Strange were they to look at, and of curious beauty, and their beauty troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils. And he felt glad, and understood not why he was glad.\r\n\r\nAnd after that he had opened the tabernacle, and incensed the monstrance that was in it, and shown the fair wafer to the people, and hid it again behind the veil of veils, he began to speak to the people, desiring to speak to them of the wrath of God. But the beauty of the white flowers troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils, and there came another word into his lips, and he spake not of the wrath of God, but of the God whose name is Love. And why he so spake, he knew not.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had finished his word the people wept, and the Priest went back to the sacristy, and his eyes were full of tears. And the deacons came in and began to unrobe him, and took from him the alb and the girdle, the maniple and the stole. And he stood as one in a dream.\r\n\r\nAnd after that they had unrobed him, he looked at them and said, \'What are the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they come?\'\r\n\r\nAnd they answered him, \'What flowers they are we cannot tell, but they come from the corner of the Fullers\' Field.\' And the Priest trembled, and returned to his own house and prayed.\r\n\r\nAnd in the morning, while it was still dawn, he went forth with the monks and the musicians, and the candle-bearers and the swingers of censers, and a great company, and came to the shore of the sea, and blessed the sea, and all the wild things that are in it. The Fauns also he blessed, and the little things that dance in the woodland, and the bright-eyed things that peer through the leaves. All the things in God\'s world he blessed, and the people were filled with joy and wonder. Yet never again in the corner of the Fullers\' Field grew flowers of any kind, but the field remained barren even as before. Nor came the Sea-folk into the bay as they had been wont to do, for they went to another part of the sea.', '2018-01-16 15:33:52', '2018-01-16 10:03:52', 0);
